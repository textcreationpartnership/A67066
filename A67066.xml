            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe, and the like, doth this ſpiritual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie produce in the Underſtanding: the Light being either quite out or dim, the Actings of the Underſtanding become irregular; and it is one of the great Works of Chriſt in our Regeneration, to give us the Spirit of Power and a ſound Mind, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st,</hi> So for the Will, this Leproſie hath as much perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34102:5"/> that, as it hath darkened the Underſtanding, and that upon a double account: Firſt, By reaſon of that Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in the Underſtanding, for the Proſecution or Averſation of the Will, is much qualified and ruled, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Light that is in the Underſtanding; and if that Light be Darkneſs, then there muſt neceſſarily follow a great miſcarriage in the Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> By reaſon of that Captivity that the Will lieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Law of Sin and the Fleſh, God gave to Man a righteous Law, which was to be a Law and Rule to his Mind, planted in him to direct and guide him in all things anſwerable to the revealed Will of God; but by reaſon of this Leproſie's corrupting the Will, it is now not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can it be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. nay, the Will is ſo much maſtered and preſſed down, by being poſſeſſed of this Leproſie, through this powerfull Law of Sin which it whers into the Soul; inſomuch when it meets with the Law of God coming into the Heart, it takes an occaſion thereby to work in the Soul all manner of Concupiſcence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. and all this, meerly out of Malice and Policy, to make the Law of God (which ſhould reſtrain the Soul from Sin, and reſcue the Soul) more odious to the Soul, and the Soul to it; as Conquerers uſe to do, who introduce Laws, Cuſtoms, and Languages of their own, the more to eſtrange the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any Memory of their former Duty and Freedoms; but now, when Chriſt comes into the Soul, he reſcues the Soul from the Dominion (though not from the being) of Sin: <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you; for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> This Leproſie hath not only darkned our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and corrupted our Wills, but it hath poiſoned our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions alſo: The great and Maſter-piece of our Affections is Love, and the prime Object of it is God; and in our original Creation our Love was rightly placed upon God, the only Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of our Love; and when our Love was rightly qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was moſt intenſe Love, according to the Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, <hi>Deut. 6. 5. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, and withal thy Might:</hi> But now this Leproſie, though we have loſt the proper Object of this Affection, yet not the Affection itſelf, but in as much as our Love hath loſt its Guide; hence it is, that it wanders
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34102:6"/> after ſomething elſe, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, ſeeking reſt amongſt the Creatures, and Pleaſures of the Fleſh, but findeth none, and at laſt takes up in ourſelves, making them the ſole Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Love and Affection; ſo that as our Love is miſplaced with reſpect to its Object, ſo it miſtakes in the purſuit of that Object; for no Man doth truly love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who doth not truly love God; becauſe the true Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Love, is to do all the good we can to the Thing we Love. Now the chiefeſt Good to ourſelves, lieth in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto the Will of God, wherein indeed lieth the beauty, happineſs, and bleſſedneſs of the Soul: Thus when a Man hath loſt the true Object of his Love, no wonder he wanders up and down, in a Wilderneſs of Miſtakes, and ſo at laſt makes himſelf the ſole Object of his Affection. <hi>Rom. 1. 25. Who hath changed the Truth of God into a Lie, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and ſerved the Creature more than the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever,</hi> Amen. So that, that Man, who terminates his Love upon himſelf, Serves and Worſhips himſelf: Thus the Order and Beauty which God at firſt planted in Man, it being corrupted and turned into ſo much Diſorder in the Soul by this Leproſie, this makes that Confuſion in all the other Affections and Paſſions of the Mind: But this is not all, But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Titus,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. This Leproſie hath defiled the Conſciences of Men, it hath firſt darkned the divine Light of God in the Soul, in a great meaſure, which hath much weakned the Evidence that Conſcience ſhould give in for God, and made it ſo much the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in its Teſtimony; ſo alſo hath it weakned it in its Power, that it ſtirs not as otherwiſe it would do, like a Man over-powered and benumbed with much heavineſs to Sleep. Hence in ſome Men, 'tis ſaid to be feared, as with a hot Iron; as ſeared Fleſh is dead Fleſh, ſo are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of ſome Men in their Breaſts, dead, powerleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to act or ſpeak. Therefore this ſpiritual Leproſie, is very lively ſhadowed out by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> corporal Leproſie, for the over-ſpreading Nature of it; a corporal Leproſie runs over all the parts of the Body, ſo doth this ſinful Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie as you have ſeen, it ſpreads itſelf over all the parts and powers of the Soul, leaving no part of it untainted: The ſame which the Prophet ſpake of the State of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34102:6"/> as a Body Politick, with reſpect to its Pollution by Sin, <hi>Iſa. 1. 6. From the ſole of the Foot unto the Head, there is no ſoundneſs in it; but Wounds, and Bruiſes, and putrifying Sores; they have not been cloſed, neither bound up, neither mollified with Ointment.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> FIrſt of all, the Reaſon and Ground of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Leproſie, took its riſe from the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> upon a double account: Firſt, Naturally. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Morally. Firſt, Naturally, as we are the Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> our firſt Father in the Fleſh; for we were vertually included in him, as a multiplicity of Seeds in the firſt Seed, and ſo reaſonably muſt partake of the ſame natural Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which were in him: For if it be granted, that his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, deſcending from him by ordinary Generation, had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the Qualities of Righteouſneſs, Wiſdom, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs from him, had he not fallen, then, is it not as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conclude, that we muſt neceſſarily partake of his Sin and Pollution (the Effects of his Fall) which faſtened upon him by his Tranſgreſſion? And that you may ſee the Atteſtation which the Spirit of God gives to this as a Truth, read <hi>Gen. 5. 3. And Adam lived a hundred and thirty Years, and begat a Son in his own Likeneſs, after his Image.</hi> Now for <hi>Adam</hi> to beget a Son after his own Image, (if we reſpect his external Form, and parts of his Body) this carried no ſuch note of Obſervation in it, for, who would expect that it would be otherwiſe? Becauſe ordinary it is not, unleſs the Birth be monſtrous; but the thing to be noted in the Text is this, That as <hi>Adam,</hi> by his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, became a poor, depraved, ſinful, leprous Creature himſelf, ſo his Child, which naturally ſprang from him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him the ſame leprous Pollution, which <hi>Adam</hi> by his Fall, procured to himſelf, and unavoidably to every one elſe which ſhould ſucceed him: But then, Secondly, It is ſo upon a moral account; becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity were in Covenant with God together, and in that Covenant, both himſelf and all his Seed, made up (as it were)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34102:7"/> one entire Man in the Account of God. <hi>Adam's</hi> Perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting (under that Covenant) every Man, Woman, and Child, that ever did or ſhould ſpring from him to the end of the World; ſo that when he fell, we all fell in him; and when he broke Covenant with his Creator, we then broke Covenant with him and in him, and conſequently when the Penalty of Covenant-breach (which was the Curſe and Death) fell upon him, it fell upon us in him at the ſame time. So reaſons the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 5. 17. For if by one Man's Offence, Death reigned by one.</hi> So. ver. 18. <hi>Therefore as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</hi> So ver. 19. <hi>For as by one Man's Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience many were made Sinners.</hi> See ver 12. alſo. So that, upon this moral Account, as by <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin, we were made Guilty, ſo by the ſame Tranſgreſſion, are we become le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouſly Filthy, <hi>Ezek. 16. 6. I ſaw thee polluted in thy Blood.</hi> Hence ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matt. 15. 19. Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, falſe Witneſs, Blaſphemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.] Why this ſpiritual Leproſie is ſo unavoidable, it's becauſe it is an Evil propagated from Father to Child, by a natural Generation; it runs in a Line from one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; it is ſuch an entailed Evil, as cannot be cut off by any thing that Man can do; it is as impoſſible for Man not to beget a leprous ſinful Subſtance, as it is for him not to beget a natural fleſhly Subſtance, if his Loins be fruitful to beget any thing at all. It is the Order which God hath planted in Nature, that every Kind ſhould bring forth his like: Therefore if a Man be an Inſtrument to produce any thing by Generation, it muſt be in his own Likeneſs; for though Man originally was not unclean, (but as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, he was made Juſt and Upright) yet as the caſe now ſtands with Man, he being corrupted with this ſinful Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, he cannot beget his own Likeneſs unleſs he do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and inſtrumentally produce an ugly Leper like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>From hence we infer theſe two Uſes:</p>

The reaſon lieth here, they come not to the Prieſt for a Cure, they make no uſe of Jeſus Chriſt for healing Grace; there is a deep <hi>Fountain opened to the Houſe of David, and to the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for Sin, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> Zech. 13. 1. but they will make no uſe of it; which Fountain being the free Grace of God, running forth through the Merit of Chriſt's Blood, publiſhing itſelf to our Souls by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word and Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, this Grace and freely profered Mercy, they neglect, ſlight, and contemn, which is the only ordinary Means of their Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Healing; now of theſe Chriſt-ſlighting and Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undervaluing Souls, there are two ſorts: Firſt, Thoſe who wilfully reſufe and ſlight the Means of their Cleanſing, which is the Miniſtry of the Word; of ſuch we read in <hi>John 5. 40. They would not come to Christ that they might have Life;</hi> that is as you read in <hi>John 6. 66. They went back from Christ,</hi> that is, they turned their Backs upon the Miniſtry of Chriſt, for 'tis ſaid, they walked no more with him; and <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you, That ſuch <hi>as refuſe Inſtruction deſpiſe their own Souls,</hi> Prov. 15. 32. Thus, through the pride and haughtineſs of their Hearts, they ſſight the Means that ſhould cleanſe them; many of them are ſo Self-conceited, that they think they know already as much as the ableſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt can tell them, and are as ready to ſay, What can the beſt of them all ſay any more to them, than they have heard long ago? Neither for the future do they expect, that their longer waiting upon their Preaching, can be any addition to that meaſure of Knowledge, which by their Miniſtry they have attained unto already: Thus by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34102:9"/> of Inſtruction, they deſpiſe their own Souls, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it not. Might not the poor Cripple, who lay at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> thirty eight Years, have ſlighted his wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that Means long within that time, upon the ſame account? For had he come off from the Pool, and in his coming off ſhould have met with any one, which might have exhorted him to a return again, and to have waited a while longer upon that healing Pool, might not he have replied, Do not I know what the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> is? Have I not ſeen the Waters of it, with the frequent Signs of the Angels troubling of them? Can any Man acquaint me with any Paſſage or Circumſtance about that Pool, which I know not as well as themſelves? And whatever others are pleaſed to ſay or affirm about the healing Vertue of it, yet for my part, I lay a Waiter upon it for thirty eight Years, and am come off a Cripple at laſt. But yet you may read, that his long waiting upon it, and keeping cloſe to it, in obedience to God's Ordinance, relating to it, had a full Recompence, with a perfect Cure; the Story you have at large in <hi>John</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Verſes. This Pool of <hi>Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> was a lively Figure of the Preaching of the Word, with the reſt of the Ordinances of the Goſpel, which are called the Healing Waters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 9. and the Fountain which is opened for <hi>Sin and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> Zech. 13. 1. And as the Waters of <hi>Betheſda</hi> healed not until the Angel came down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, giving a preſent Vertue to them for that purpoſe; ſo the Word and Ordinances of the Goſpel, muſt receive their Power and Vertue from the Preſence of Chriſt in them, who is the Angel of the Covenant; this and only this makes them healing to our leprous Souls, <hi>John 15. 3. Now are you Clean through the Word which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> Beware then, as you value your Souls, that you give not way to a haughty Spirit, in ſlighting and neglecting the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters of the Sanctuary, for fear leſt you Periſh and Die in your Leproſies: Oh! read and tremble at that word in <hi>Heb. 2. 3. How ſhall we Eſcape if we neglect ſo great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> There are a ſecond ſort of Lepers which are not heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the cleanſing Means of the Word and Ordinances of the Goſpel, and they are your careleſs Hearers; which tho they attend upon the Means and Miniſtry of the Word,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34102:10"/> yet they do not ſeriouſly intend any ſaving Benefit to their Souls thereby. There are many whoſe Conſciences will not allow them to neglect an Ordinance, yet never propoſe to themſelves any ſpiritual End in their waiting upon them: There are ſeveral that will travel ſome Miles to be at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Meeting, where the Word is preached, but never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Converſion and Regeneration of their Souls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Such as theſe who have no higher End in waiting upon the Goſpel, but only to keep Peace with their Conſciences, are in the Eyes of Chriſt no better than Refuſers of that healing Means, which he holds forth to them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, there being (in his account) little difference betwixt not regarding the end of the Means and an open refuſal of it; of ſuch we read in <hi>Ezck. 33. 31, 32. They come unto thee, as the People cometh, and ſit before thee as my People, and they hear thy Words; but they will not do them, for with their Mouths they ſhew much Love, but their Hearts goeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Covetouſneſs; for lo thou art unto them as a very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Song of one that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well on an Inſtrument, for they hear thy Words, but they do them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> A ſecond thing obſervable about the Leper, is this: After he had been with the Prieſt, and if his Diſeaſe was found to be a Leproſie, he was then to be ſeparated from the reſt of his Brethren, <hi>Lev. 13. 46. All the Days wherein the Plague ſhall be in him; he ſhall be Defiled, he is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, he ſhall dwell alone, without the Camp ſhall his Habitation be.</hi> Now if we apply this to the Anti-type, we may note this Truth from it:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That thoſe Perſons, which are under the Power of their ſpiritual Leproſies and Pollutions, are not only unfit for Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Communion with God, but with his People alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Truth ſo clear, as if it were written with the Beams of the ſhining Sun: As, firſt of all, That God and ſpiritual Lepers (whoſe Leproſie is reigning in them) can have no Fellowſhip nor Communion together: <hi>Iſa. 59. 2. Your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your Sins have hid his Face from you.</hi> Hab. 1. 13. <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, nor canst thou behold Evil.</hi> 2 Cor. 14. 15. <hi>What Fellowſhip hath Righteouſneſs with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs, and what Concord hath Christ with Belial.</hi> Yea,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34102:10"/> though he be a King in his Royal Robes, and hath this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie on him in the Dominion of it, God will have no Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him though he ſits upon the Throne, <hi>Pſal. 94. 20. Shall the Throne of Iniquity have Fellowſhip with thee, which frameth Miſchief by a Law?</hi> Thus, as God will have no Fellowſhip with Lepers himſelf, ſo hath he prohibited his People from the ſame; this you ſee in <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 46. That as ſoon as the Leproſie did appear upon any <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> he was to be ſeparated from the Camp, he was to have no more Communion with his Brethren, nor they with him until his Leproſie were healed: And doth not the Apoſtle ſeem to apply this in a ſpiritual Senſe to the People of God, as a Rule to be obſerved by the Churches of Chriſt in the times of the Goſpel? Doth he not ſay in 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 15. What part hath he that believeth with an Infidel?</hi> So 2 Theſſ. 3. 14. <hi>If any Man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that Man, and have no Company with him, that he may be aſhamed.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 11. But now I have written unto you, not to keep Company; if any Man that is called a Brother, be a Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch a one, no not to Eat.</hi> Thus you ſee how plain and clear it is, Firſt, That God will not; and, Secondly, His Will is, that his People ſhould not have any Fellowſhip with ſpiritual Lepers. And ſo we come to the Reaſon upon which this Truth is bottomed.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is this, That as one ſcabbed Sheep may ſpoil a whole Flock, ſo may one ſpiritual Leper ſpoil a whole Church: The Apoſtle told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that one ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Perſon amongſt them, might leaven all the reſt of the Society; if not with the ſame ſpiritual Pollution, yet with ſo much Guilt for their allowing of him amongſt them, which might procure ſome heavy Judgment upon them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. It's true, while we are in the World, we cannot avoid a common Commerce with them, upon a civil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but we ought to avoid a ſpiritual Communion with them, in the higheſt Chriſtian Ordinance, upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe they are Lepers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> This then may ſerve for Inſtruction to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt: Firſt, Who they ſhould keep out. Secondly, Who they ſhould keep out. Secondly, Who they ſhould thruſt out of their Fellowſhips and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:34102:11"/>
               <p>Firſt of all, this Truth may reach them who ſhould keep out of their Fellowſhips and Communion: namely, The leprous Perſon. None can deny but that the Houſe of <hi>Iſael</hi> were the viſible Church of God; and few but will grant, That a ſpiritual Leproſie, is far more dangerous, therefore more to be avoided, than that which is corporal; ſo then, if the Church of God under the Law, were to drive out from their Communion, thoſe which had the leſs dangerous Leproſie, then ſurely the Churches of Chriſt in Goſpel-times, ought to keep out thoſe from their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which have the more dangerous Leproſie upon them; therefore the ſame which the Apoſtle ſaith of him that is a Brother, may very well be applied to one (that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to particular Church-communion) would be a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>If he be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or a Drunkard, or a Railer, or an Idolater, or an Extortioner, with ſuch a one, no not to Eat,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> This ſerves to inſtruct the People of God, who they are which they ſhould thruſt out of their Fellowſhips and Communion, <hi>(viz)</hi> Every ſpiritual unclean Leper, that will not be cleanſed; you have ſeen, that as ſoon as the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was broken out upon the Body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Leper, he was immediately put out of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which Camp was the Church of God: <hi>Lev. 13. 46. As long as his Diſeaſe ſhall be upon him, he ſhall be defiled, he is unclean, he ſhall dwell alone, without the Camp ſhall be his Habitation.</hi> So alſo you may read, how agreeable to this Levitical Rule, is the Order which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-churches, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Verſes. This ſpecial Care which ought to be taken by the Churches, in keeping cloſe to this Rule, is not only enjoyned upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel, but it was the great Duty of the Prieſts and Prophets under the Levitical Adminiſtration, <hi>Jer. 15. 19. If thou take forth the Precious from the Vile, thou ſhalt be as my Mouth; let them return to thee, but return not thou unto them,</hi> Ezek. 44. 6, 7. with Ver. 9. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſay to the Rebellious, even to the Houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, thus ſaith the Lord, O ye Houſe of Iſrael, let it ſuffice you for all your Abominations, in that you have brought into my Sanctuary Strangers uncircumciſed in Heart, and uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Fleſh, to be in my Sanctuary to pollute it, even my Houſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:34102:11"/> 
                  <hi>when ye offer my Bread, the Fat and the Blood, and they have broken my Covenant, becauſe of all your Abominations.</hi> Only this Rule is to be obſerved, before the Leper is to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, <hi>Matt. 18. 15, 16. Go and tell him his Fault between thee and him alone; if he ſhall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Brother, but if he hear thee not, then tell it to the Church.</hi> It is not ſimply the Offence committed, which proves a Ground of caſting out the ſpiritual Leper; but it's his perſifting in his Offence, his refuſing to return, and his unwillingneſs to be cleanſed.</p>
               <p>Thus far touching the Action of the Leper, in order to his Cleanſing: Firſt, He was to be brought to the Prieſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, If his Diſeaſe were found to be a Leproſie, then was he to be ſeparated from all Communion and Fellowſhip with his Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> We next come to the Action of the Prieſt, by whom the Cure was to be wrought, and here we ſhall handle the Action of the Prieſt, together with the Means he was to uſe in order to the Cleanſing of the Leper, <hi>Lev. 14. 4, 5, 6, 7. Then ſhall the Priest command to take for him that is to be cleanſed, two Birds alive, and clean, and Cedar-wood, and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and Hyſſop. And the Priest ſhall command that one of the Birds be killed in an earthen Veſſel, over running Water. As for the living Bird he ſhall take, and the Cedar-wood, and the Scarlet, and the Hyſſop, and ſhall dip them and the living Bird, in the Blood of the Bird that was killed over the running Water. And he ſhall ſprinkle upon him that is to be cleanſed from the Leproſie, ſeven times, and ſhall pronounce him Clean, and ſhall let the living. Bird looſe into the open Field.</hi> Now for the opening of this Myſtery, we ſhall begin with the two Birds, which ſome think were two Sparrows, and they are called Clean, with reſpect to that Statute, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. which made the difference betwixt Things allowed and diſallowed to be Eaten; thoſe Creatures which were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Eaten, were called Clean, of which kind were theſe Birds that are here uſed in the cleanſing of the Leper. Now theſe two Birds are very ſignificant of the twofold Work of Chriſt in our ſpiritual Cleanſing from our leprous and polluted Natures.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all, you read that the firſt Bird was killed, which ſhadowed out the Death of Chriſt; for as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34102:12"/> could not be healed of his corporal Leproſie without the ſhedding of the Blood of the innocent Sparrow, no more could we be healed of our ſpiritual Leproſie of Sin, without the ſhedding of the Blood of an innocent Saviour, 1 <hi>John 1. 7. And the Bloud of Jeſus Christ cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Rev. 5. 9. <hi>For thou wast Slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood.</hi> Heb. 9. 22. <hi>And without ſhedding of Blood is no Remiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> The living Bird was to be let looſe, or to be let to fly away into the open Field, which ſignified the Action of Chriſt in order to his Work of Interceſſion, who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be let go from the Grave, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from thence he might take his flight for Heaven, there to fit at the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of God, to make Interceſſion for us, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. For as by his Death upon the Croſs, he made a full and compleat Satisfaction for all our Sins; ſo by his Aſcention to Heaven, he there is making continual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for Sinners; and as by his Death upon the Croſs, he made Peace with God for us, ſo by his Interceſſion, he maintains that Peace with God for us. And, again, as he by his bleſſed Sacrifice (in offering up of himſelf) did thereby purchaſe our Right to all the Promiſes, relating to Life and God lineſs, ſo by his Interceſſion he powerfully prevails with his Father, that the Good of them might come down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> And whereas you read, That the living Bird, with the Scarlet, the Cedar-wood, and the Hyſſop, all which was to be dipt into the Blood of the ſlain Bird; this being done, it made the Scarlet, the Cedar-wood, and the Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, ſo effectual in the Cleanſing of the Leper. This great Myſtery, ſignifies thus much to us, when applied to its Anti-type, That what Benefit upon a ſaving account there is in Chriſt, or of Chriſt, which any do receive in order to their effectual Redemption, and Soul-cleanſing, it doth all originate in, or originally proceed from the Vertue, Worth, and Merit of the Sufferings and Blood of Chriſt, as the procuring cauſe of all. Have we any Benefit by any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, or Righteouſneſs in Chriſt, Grace from Chriſt, or relation to Chriſt? All this flows from the Spring and Fountain of a Chriſt crucified and flain for Sin; for you plainly ſee, that all the Means which was uſed in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34102:12"/> Cleanſing of the corporal Leper, took its Efficacy from the Bloud of the ſlain Bird, the Scarlet, the Cedar-wood, and the Hyſſop, were all dipt in the Bloud of the ſlain Bird. From whence we may note this Obſervation:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That the Bloud of Christ ſhed for Sin, is the only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing-cauſe, of all the Grace, Mercy, and Favour, which the Elect of God are capable to receive, both in the Life that now is, and that which is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Truth which doth abundantly evidence itſelf from the Scriptures; Have we Grace and Sanctification in this Life? This the Scripture attributes to the Bloud of Chriſt, as the Procuring-cauſe of it, <hi>Heb. 9. 14. The Bloud of Christ purgeth our Conſciences from dead Works, to ſerve the Living God.</hi> Have we Peace with God? This he hath procured by the Bloud of his Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. Have we Power and Strength to overcome our ſpiritual Enemies. Satan and the Luſts of the Fleſh? This is done by the Bloud of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11. In a word, There is not a good Action done or performed by us, but the Grace which enables us thereunto, is the Fruit of Chriſt's Bloud, <hi>Heb. 13. 20, 21. The God that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Christ, the great Biſhop of our Souls, through the Bloud of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work to do his Will, working in you that which is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Christ.</hi> Is it Aſſurance, Joy, Peace in believing the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt have procured this alſo, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, 14 Verſes: And ſo for Heaven and Glory to come, this is the Fruit of Chriſt's Purchaſing-bloud which hath accompliſhed all this, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come the Reaſon of the Point:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> This muſt be ſo, becauſe, what Good the Elect of God partake from him, either in this World, or in the World to come, let it be to their Sanctification here, or their Glorification hereafter; all this muſt flow forth to them from the Love of God, as the grand Cauſe of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6 Verſes, <hi>But God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickned us together with Christ, by Grace are ye ſaved, and hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Christ Jeſus in heavenly Places.</hi> So that you plainly ſee, to be quickned from a Death in Sin, and to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34102:13"/> be graciouſly Saved, (that is, from the Curſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and from the Dominion of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. and from the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating-power of the Devil, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. and from the Wrath of God, <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 10. And after all this, to be dignified and exalted to that hight of Honour,) ſo as to be made to ſit with Chriſt, yea together with him in heavenly Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Apoſtle tells you in the fourth Verſe, That the great Love of God is the Foundation of all this to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: Now it cannot be, that God ſhould deal with his Elect in ſuch a way of Love, until he be-firſt reconciled to them, and becomes their Friend; now he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Friend until a Reconciliation be made, for them, which was done, wrought out, and brought about by the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 5. 8. In that while we were yet Sinners, Christ died for us.</hi> So Verſe 10. <hi>When we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi> So <hi>Col. 1. 20. And, having made Peace by the Bloud of his Croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf.</hi> Thus you ſee, how, through the Bloud of Chriſt, the innocent Bird and Lamb of God, the way is abundantly opened, to God the Father's letting forth of his Grace and Love to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, whom he had ordained thereunto, before the World began, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to make ſome Application of the whole:</p>
               <p>1ſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Is to teach us Thankfulneſs to the ever-bleſſed God, for this ſpecial Benefit, which he hath ſo graciouſly afforded us in order to our ſpiritual Cleanſing. Oh! Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this was the higheſt Act of God's Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to the loſt Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> that could be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven itſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. but God commended his Love towards us, in that while we were Sinners, Chriſt died for us: The meaning is, That there was nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this that could afford a higher Evidence of the Grace and Good-will of God to the loſt World: For God to create us Creatures, was a wonderful Expreſſion of his Power and Wiſdom, it being a bringing of ſomething out of nothing, a moſt adorable Act; but to ſave them when loſt, the Fruit of which is their being made new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God before ordained that we ſhould walk
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34102:13"/> in them, <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 2. 10. This was the higheſt Expreſſion of God's Wiſdom, Power, Love, and Grace, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could be manifeſted in the Face of Men and Angels. What could <hi>Abraham</hi> give to God, of all he did poſſeſs, beyond the Life of his Son <hi>Iſaac?</hi> And, What could God give more to Sinners, than the Life of his Son? <hi>John 3. 16.

               <p>WE are next to ſpeak to the earthen Veſſel, over which the Innocent Bird was to be killed, in which Veſſel was the running Water, <hi>Lev. 14. 5. And the Priest ſhall command that one of the Birds be killed in an earthen Veſſel, over running Water.</hi> (Mark,) It muſt be running Water, which ſignifies the Purity and the Livelineſs of it, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtanding Water, which is uſually dead and corrupt; therefore this Water in the earthern Veſſel, muſt be run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Water, it muſt be Water that hath Life and Purity in it.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, to begin with the earthen Veſſel, which may ſignifie the reality of the Humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, from whence our Healing comes: You ſee that the Leper was cleanſed by the Bloud of the Bird, and ſo muſt we be cleanſed (from ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Soul-leproſie) by the Bloud of Chriſt, if ever we be cleanſed indeed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. Now this Bloud could not proceed from Chriſt, as he was only God, abſtracted from his Manhood; for as he was God only, he was no way capable either to ſuffer or to ſhed Bloud; therefore the Godhead of Chriſt aſſumes an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Veſſel, even our Humane Nature to his Divine, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the earthen Veſſel, over which the Sparrow was to be killed, that ſo out of that Humane Nature, he might iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue forth the Bloud of our Cleanſing: He was born of a Virgin, he took her very Nature upon him, but not the Sinfulneſs of it in the leaſt degree, no, he left all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and this Humane Nature was very earthly, for from the Earth it came, and to the Earth it muſt return again: And, inaſmuch as the Body of our Saviour was made up of this earthy Nature, he (as to his Body) may well be called an earthen Veſſel, ſignified by the Veſſel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which the Bird was killed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the running Water, in this earthen Veſſel, is underſtood by ſome, the Water of Sanctification, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34102:14"/> comes from him, for, ſaith <hi>John, He came by Water and Bloud:</hi> But this cannot be excluſive of the Divine Nature of the Son of God, which rendred the whole Sacrifice of Chriſt, only ſufficient to Cleanſe us from our ſpiritual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, and Soul-pollution, in the ſight of God. For as the Godhead of Chriſt, could not iſſue forth Bloud to Cleanſe us, (apart from his Manhood) ſo neither could the Bloud of Chriſt (apart from his Godhead) have been any way availing to our Cleanſing from the Guilt or Filth of Sin in our Souls; ſo that the Union of the two Natures, in the Perſon of Chriſt, became ſo wonderfully efficacious to our Juſtification and Sanctification, wherein lieth the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's ſpiritual Cleanſing; hence, Chriſt's Bloud is called the Bloud of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. becauſe of the Union of the two Natures in the Perſon of Chriſt. Thus you ſee how the earthen Veſſel and the pure Water muſt go together in our ſpiritual Cleanſing.</p>
               <p>From whence we ſhall obſerve this Note:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That the Bloud of Jeſus Christ, who is very God, and very Man, is the only appointed Means to Cleanſe our Souls from our ſinful Leproſies and Pollutions in the Sight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth of this cannot be called in queſtion by any, who queſtion not the Truth of Scripture, <hi>Rev. 1. 5. And from Jeſus, who is the faithful Witneſs, the first Begotten from the Dead, unto him that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his own Bloud.</hi> Rev. 5. 9. <hi>For thou wast Slain, and hast Redeemed us unto God by thy Bloud.</hi> 1 John 1. 7. <hi>And the Bloud of Jeſus Christ cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Heb. 9. 14. <hi>The Bloud of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf without Spot to God, purge your Conſciences from dead Works to ſerve the Living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Reaſons of this Truth, and the firſt is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1.] It muſt be ſo, becauſe the Bloud of Chriſt is the only Means which God hath appointed to be uſed for this Purpoſe, in oppoſition to all other Means whatſoever, <hi>Acts 4. 12. Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other Name under Heaven, whereby we must be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.] And it muſt be ſo, becauſe, as God hath only appointed this Means for Soul-cleanſing, ſo hath he (only) fitted this Means for Soul-recovery: <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. The</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:34102:15"/> 
                  <hi>Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed me to preach good Tidings unto the Meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the Broken-hearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and to open the Priſon Doors to them that are Bound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, whoever they are that ſhall make uſe of nay other Means, beſides this, for the Cure of their Souls, will find it ſo far from Cleanſing, that himſelf will be found guilty of the higheſt Preſumption, becauſe it is a ſlighting of the Bloud of the Covenant, and counting it a common thing, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. and then, upon ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſame Apoſtle tells you, that ſuch Men who are found guilty of ſuch a Sin, will find it <hi>a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God,</hi> Ver. 31.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> And by the Scarlet Thread, we may underſtand the Purchaſing-bloud of Chriſt, which is the Procuring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that Vertue, and Healing-property which we find and feel in the Word and Faith, in order to our ſpiritual Cleanſing: Now the Sprinkling-bruſh being thus finiſhed, the Scarlet Thread binding the Hyſſop to the Cedar-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; with this Bruſh, the Prieſt was to ſprinkle the Leper ſeven times, the Sum of which holds out to us, our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification, which is procured for us by our High-Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:34102:16"/>
               <p>From all which we may obſerve this Point of Doctrine: Doct. <hi>That who-ever intends to be Juſtified from the Guilt of Sin, and Sanctified from the Filth of Sin, must get himſelf ſprinkled with the Bloud of Christ, through the Word of God, by the Hyſſop of Faith and Believing.</hi> Hence the Scripture attributes, both our Juſtification and Sanctification to the Bloud of Chriſt, as the meritorious and Procuring-cauſe of it: Firſt, For our Juſtification, <hi>Rom. 5. 9. Much more then, being now Juſtified by his Bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Our Sanctification is meritoriouſly procured by the ſame Means, <hi>Heb. 9. 14. How much more ſhall the Bloud of Christ purge our Conſciences from dead Works to ſerve the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As the Scriptures do direct us to the Bloud of Chriſt alone, as the meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, ſo doth it direct to Faith as the Means which only can make the Application of both to the Soul, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being Juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> Not that Faith can Juſtifie of itſelf, a part from the Object of it, which is Jeſus Chriſt, but only as Faith apprehends and applies the Bloud and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt to the Soul, which is the alone Matter of our Juſtification; and as Faith is the Inſtrument of our Juſtification, ſo it is of our Sanctification alſo, <hi>Acts 15. 9. And put no difference betweeen them and us, purifying their Hearts by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> Now, the Reaſon why the Soul is to make uſe of Faith, in his Juſtification from the Guilt of Sin, and in his Cleanſing from the Filth of Sin, is, becauſe God hath ordered Faith to be the Grace, which muſt deal with the Bloud of Chriſt, which is the Procuring-cauſe of both: For as nothing can Juſtifie or Cleanſe the Soul (if applied) but the Bloud of Chriſt, ſo there is nothing which can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Bloud of Chriſt to the Soul, but the Hyſſop of Faith and Believing, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. But without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſible to Pleaſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Application of the Point:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe,</hi> This ſhould teach us all to look after Faith, yea, above all things, to labour for this Grace of Believing, if ever we mean to be healed of our ſinful Leproſie and Uncleanneſs. Oh Friends! this is the Means that can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34102:16"/> only do your Souls good; ſlight this, and you ſlight your greateſt Mercy under Heaven; becauſe you thereby ſlight that very Means which God hath appointed for a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: Neglect this (ſaith Chriſt) and you die in your Sins, <hi>John</hi> 8. 24. This was <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Sin, and that which kept them in their Sins, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. They ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God, which is elſe-where called the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. It was not enough for the Jewiſh Leper, only to uſe the Bloud of the Bird, for his Cleanſing, no, but he muſt dip the Hyſſop-bruſh into the Bloud alſo, he muſt keep to the Means, and the whole Means, which God inſtituted and appointed for his Cleanſing, <hi>Deut. 12. 32. What t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ng ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have commanded you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Prieſt had uſed the Hyſſop-bruſh, without the Bloud of the Bird, or if he had dipt the Hyſſop-bruſh in any other Liquor, as Water, Milk, or Wine, this would not have been Cleanſing to the Leper; or, if he had made uſe of the Bloud of the Bird, without dipping of the Hyſſop-bruſh into it, this would all as little have wrought the Cure, becauſe this would have been a Contradiction to God s Inſtitut on; but both of the Means muſt be uſed together the Bloud of the Bird, with the Hyſſop-bruſh bound faſt to the Cedar-wood, theſe three things together would be Healing to the Leper, becauſe it was the Means of God's Appointment.</p>
               <p>The Myſtery of which (when opened) ſhews us thus much, That the Bloud of Chriſt, handed, out to us by the Word of God, and applied to our Souls by Faith, (it being the Inſtitution of God for our Soul-cure) this, and only this, will Cleanſe our Souls of the fouleſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profie that ever hapned to a Sinner in this Life; for we find, that it was this which <hi>David</hi> deſired might be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, in a time of Soul-defilement and Pollution, <hi>Pſal. 51. 7.

Ceaſe not, give him no reſt until he hath ſent down the Hyſſop-bruſh of Believing into thy Heart, that by it, thy Heart may be purified from thy Soul-pollution, according to <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. A ſight of Miſery does ſometimes (in a tender-hearted Phyſician) ſtir up Bowels of Mercy to a ready Helping of the Diſtreſſed; but much more in God, the greateſt Healer and Helper that is in Heaven or Earth; and for thy Encouragement to make to him for Healing, read often that Text, <hi>Jam. 1. 5.

This Work was done by a Synecdochy, tipping ſome parts of the Body for the whole, which vertually comprehends the ſeveral Parts of the Whole Man; which Miſtery ſhadows out theſe two things to us, namely, Our Juſtification and Sanctification by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Lamb that was to be killed, was a Type of Chriſt dying for Sinners, as the Bird was before, the Bloud of both being of one and the ſame Signification, typing out the Bloud of Chriſt, as the meritorious Cauſe of our being waſhed and cleanſed from the Guilt of all our Sins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>2. The Oyl uſed in this Cleanſing-work, typed forth to us the Graces of the Spirit of God in our Sanctification, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 1 <hi>John 2. 27. But the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the ſame Anointing teacheth you all things, and is Truth.</hi> New we need not queſtion, but that <hi>John</hi> the Divine hath referrence to the Anointing-oyl which was poured forth upon the Head of the levitical High-Prieſt, who was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 30. of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks more at large in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 133. Ver. 2. which the Apoſtle applies to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34102:18"/> 
                  <hi>Thus hast loved Rightouſneſs and hated Iniquity, therefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee with the Oyl of Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs above thy Fellows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And one reaſon that's given of Chriſt's being anointed, you have in <hi>John,</hi> John 1. 16. <hi>That of his Fulneſs we might all receive, and Grace for Grace:</hi> For as Oyl is beautifying to the Countenance, mollifying to the Fleſh, and cheering to the Heart, ſo is the Oyl of Grace and Sanctification; its beautifying to the Soul, <hi>Ezek. 16. 14. Thou art Perfect through my Comelineſs put upon thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> It's ſoftning to the Heart, <hi>Job 23. 16. For God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my Heart ſoft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> And it is comforting and cheering to the Whole Man, <hi>Pſal. 4. 7. Thou hast put Gladneſs into my Heart, more than in the time that their Corn and Wine increaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more to be obſerved in the Cleanſing the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Leper, is this; namely, That the Prieſt was to make an Application both of the Bloud and Oil to the Leper; not the Bloud without the Oil, nor the Oil without the Bloud, but both of them together, as ſoon as the Prieſt could apply each one after the other, the Bloud applied firſt, and then the Oil next.</p>
               <p>From hence we may obſerve this Point of Doctrine: Doct. <hi>That when Christ doth Juſtifie a Soul by his Bloud, the ſame doth he Sanctifie by the Oil of his Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look through the whole Book of God, and you will find nothing more a truth than this, nor can you read of one Perſon therein, who is recorded for a juſtified Man, by the Bloud of Chriſt, but you ſhall find it affirmed of him, that he was a ſanctified Man by the Oil of Chriſt's Grace; beſides, How fully doth the Word ſpeak out the Truth of the thing itſelf, <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Moreover, whom he did Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, them he alſo Called.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 2. <hi>Elect, according to the Fore-knowledge of God, through the Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> 1 John 5. 6, 7, 8. <hi>This is he that came by Water and Bloud, even Jeſus Christ, not by Water only, but by Water and Bloud; for there are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and theſe three are one; and there are three that bear Witneſs in Earth, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Water and Bloud, and theſe three agree in one.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 13. <hi>Becauſe God hath from the beginning, choſen you to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thro Sanctification and Belief of the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34102:18"/>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Reaſon of the Point:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> Now the Reaſon why, where Chriſt Juſtifies by his Bloud, there he Sanctifies by his Spirit, is, that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified might be made meet and fit Temples for himſelf to live in here; and alſo, that they may be filled and made meet to dwell with him hereafter. Firſt, Chriſt muſt dwell in his People here in this Life, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 17. That Christ may dwell in your Hearts by Faith.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19. <hi>Know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own.</hi> Thus, as Chriſt fits the Souls of his People, by Grace and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as Temples for himſelf to dwell in here, ſo alſo by the ſame means doth he prepare them, that they may be Company meet to dwell with him in Glory hereafter, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 14. Whereunto he hath called you by our Goſpel, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Glory of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> Col. 1. 12. <hi>Who hath made you meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it's only Sanctification that can fit, prepare, and qualifie the Soul, as a Habitation fit for Chriſt to take up his Reſidence in, while in this Life; and it is nothing ſhort of true Sanctification, which can prepare the Soul to live in Glory with Chriſt, when this Life is over, <hi>Acts 15. 9. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying their Hearts by Faith. And, without Holineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon of the Point is this, becauſe, all thoſe which are Chriſt's juſtified Ones, are ordained thereby to bring forth Fruit to God; this is what our Saviour told his Diſciples, That the reaſon why his Father elected them by his Grace, and why himſelf redeemed them by his Bloud, and juſtified them by his Obedience, all this was that they might bring forth holy Fruit to God, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 10. For ye are his Workmanſhip, created in Christ Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould Walk in them.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be Holy, and without Blame before him in Love.</hi> John 15. 16. <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordained you, that you ſhould go and bring forth Fruit, and your Fruit ſhould remain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Fruitfulneſs can never be brought forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace and Sanctification be firſt poured forth upon the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34102:19"/> Heart; for, whatever the Fruit be that is brought forth, it can be of no other kind than the Root is from whence it ſprings; if the Root be but Nature's Qualification, (take it in its higheſt Flouriſh) yet the Fruit, which ſprings from it, is but Rottenneſs and Hypocriſie in the ſight of God: The beſt that is ſpoken of the Fruit which the Children of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do bring forth in the Eyes of God, is what you have recorded in <hi>Deut. 32. 32, 33. For their Vine is as the Vine of</hi> Sodom, <hi>and of the Fields of</hi> Gamorrah; <hi>their Grapes are Grapes of Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> their Cluſters are bitter, their Wine is the Poiſon of Dragons, and the cruel Venome of Aſps.</hi> So that where the Oil of Grace is not the Root, there the beſt of our Obedience will not paſs for Fruit in God's Eyes, <hi>Matt. 7. 18. A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</hi> Therefore the Root muſt be Grace and Sanctification, or the Fruit will meet with no leſs than final Rejection: Let it be the greateſt of Self-denial, Patience, Temperance, Self-mortification, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Works of Charity, Prayer, with the performance of any other Duties done in the Worſhip of God, if it flows not from the Root of true Grace and Sanctification in the Heart, all is abominable in the Sight of God, <hi>Prov. 21. 27. The Sacrifices of the Wicked is Abomination, how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked Mind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> This ſhews us then, how much they are miſtaken about their eternal State, who think they are Juſtified by Chriſt's Bloud, and yet were never Sanctified by his Spirit. How many Thouſands are there of theſe, living in a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profeſſing Kingdom, which are held under the Power of this Soul-damning Deluſion, who will not believe, but they are Juſtified in the ſight of God, though they were never yet Sanctified in the fight of Men? They are juſt like a company of Drunkards, who dreamed, that they were all Feaſting in a Royal Palace; but when they awoke, they found themſelves made faſt, with their Feet in the Stocks: Of ſuch a ſort of Dreamers <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jam. 2. 18. Yea, a Man may ſay, Thou hast Faith, and I have Works; ſhew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works. Thou believest there is one God, thou doest well; the Devils alſo believe, and tremble: But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that Faith without Works is dead.</hi> Oh
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34102:19"/> never think, that the Bloud of Atonement hath been ſhed for thee, if the Oil of Sanctification hath not been poured forth upon thee.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe is to inſtruct us how to attain to ſome hopeful Aſſurance of our Juſtification, which is by a Trial made of our Sanctification; I know that it is much a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amongſt the doubting part of Chriſtians, Oh, How ſhall we do to know whether we be in a Juſtified State and Condition?</p>

Grace</hi> imbitters Sin to the Soul, <hi>Jen 2. 91. Grace</hi> crucifies the World with the Affections and Luſts thereof, <hi>Gal. 5. 24. Gal. 6. 24. Grace</hi> puts the higheſt Value upon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil. 3. 8. Grace</hi> makes the Word ſweeter than the Honey-comb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. In a word, The gracious Soul can better live without its appointed Food, than it can without Prayer, <hi>Pſal. 55. 17. Pſal. 109. 4. Grace</hi> is a living Principle, which never will lie ſtill, but will be working, ſtirring, acting and moving in the Soul: <hi>Grace</hi> cannot be idle, it will ſtill be bringing forth things new and old; here you have a Looking-glaſs before you, preſent your Hearts before this Glaſs, and ſee what you can eſpy of theſe Signs of <hi>Grace</hi> within your Souls, in order to the finding out of your Juſtification by the Bloud of Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain for the Cleanſing of your ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Leproſie.</p>
               <p>2. Thus, after the Prieſt had poured out the Oil into the Palm of his Hand, we next come to take notice of the Parts of the Leper's Body, which the Prieſt was to apply the Oil unto, and that was to the Tip or Lap of the right Ear, the Thumb of the right Hand, and the great Toe of the right Foot, which Parts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Ear, Thumb or Hand, and Foot, are the three principal Members of Service to the whole Body; and you find, that the Bloud of Chriſt, which was typed out by the Bloud of the Lamb and the Bird, the Apoſtle calls it the Price which Bought us. Now the Purchaſe which Chriſt made for us, is twofold:</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34102:20"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st,</hi> From the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> He by the ſame Price bought us for his Uſe and Service, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20. For ye are Bought with a Price, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glorifie God in your Bodies and Souls, which are the Lord's.</hi> So that the Prieſt's putting of the Bloud and Oil upon the right Ear, Hand and Foot, of the Leper, that was to be Cleanſed, ſhadowed out theſe Myſteries to us:</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, as to Prieſt's applying of the Bloud of the ſlain Lamb, to the right Ear, Hand and Foot, which are the three principal Members of Service to the whole Body, it notes to us this Truth for our Obſervation, That the ſame Bloud of Chriſt, which redeemed us from Wrath to come, did alſo purchaſe us for that Work and Service which he commands us to do for him; for ſo much as this I gather from the Prieſt's tipping of the right Ear, Thumb, and Toe of the right Foot of the Leper, with the Bloud of the ſlain Lamb, which Lamb was a Type of Chriſt; which Action held a Congruity to the levitical Manner of making Men perpetual Servants to the Jewiſh Maſters, <hi>Exod. 21. 5, 6. If the Servant ſhall plainly ſay, I love my Maſter, my Wife, and my Children, I will not go out free; then his Maſter ſhall bring him unto the. Judges, he ſhall alſo bring him unto the Door, or to the Door-post, and his Maſter ſhall bore his Ear through with an Awl, and he ſhall ſerve him for ever.</hi> So in like manner, the Leper that was to be Cleanſed, was to have the Bloud of the Lamb tipt upon his Ear, to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Servant of the levitical Adminiſtration (by which he was Cleanſed) for ever.</p>
               <p>Now, inaſmuch as the Bloud of the Lamb, (by which the corporal Leper was Cleanſed) was a Type of the Bloud of Chriſt, and the corporal Leper a Figure of a ſpiritual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and his corporal Cleanſing binding him to perpetual Service, typocal of that perpetual Obligation which every ſpiritual-cleanſed Leper lies under to Chriſt, altogether af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us this Note:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That he which intends to be redeemed from Sin, the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law and Wrath to come, must become willing to give up himſelf to the Service of Christ for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:34102:20"/>
               <p>For the proof of this Truth, read 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19, 20. You are not your own, you are bought with a Price, therefore glorifie God in your Bodies and Spirits, which are God's.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, O, ye <hi>Corinthians,</hi> remember that the Bloud of your Redemption hath been put upon the tip of your right Ears, your Hands, and Feet, in token of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Service to Chriſt, as the Levitical-ſervant had his Ear bored through with an Awl, to be his Maſter's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for ever; Oh, ſo hath the Bloud of Chriſt been upon your Ears alſo, to make you his perpetual Servants for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>you are bought with a Price, you are not your own, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glorifie him in your Bodies and Spirits, which are his.</hi> Have a care that you rob him not of his Right in you, in giving that Service to the Devil, World, and the Fleſh, which is only due to him.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Reaſon of the Point:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> Why, that Soul, who would have Redemption by Chriſt, muſt be willing to become a perpetual Servant to Chriſt, is becauſe Chriſt redeems none, but upon that Condition, <hi>Iſa. 1. 19. If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good things of the Land.</hi> Heb. 5. 9. <hi>He is the Author of eternal Salvation, to as many as obey him.</hi> Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ye mortifie the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> So Ver. 6. <hi>For to be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is Life and Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how Conditional the Promiſes are, which ſpeak out a Soul's Benefit, by the Redeeming-bloud of Chriſt, which do all call upon us for a willing, chearful and ſincerc Obedience to Chriſt, though we grant, That it is not an old, but a New Covenant-condition, even ſuch a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Grace and gracious Aid, which only can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to perform the Condition, is graciouſly given into the Soul by Jeſus Chriſt, and who will as graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our Endeavours, (though clothed with many Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Infirmities) ſo that our Obedience to him be but ſincere, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 12. If there be first a willing Mind, it is accepted according to what a Man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we come to make ſome Application of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</p>

               <p>1ſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> This informs us then, why the Number is ſo ſmall, which comes under the Yoke of Jeſus Chriſt; the Reaſon is, becauſe there are ſo few that are willing to come up to the Terms he propounds, which is, a willing Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Government of his Word and Spirit, which is the Condition he propounds to all that would have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Salvation: They would willingly accept of his Bloud to waſh away the Guilt of Sin from their Souls, but they like not to have it tipt or applied to their Ears, to engage them to his Work and Service: they would be made happy, but not holy; but this cannot be, becauſe this would prove a flat Contradiction to the Deſign of God, in ſending of his Son from Heaven, <hi>Iſa. 55. 4. Behold, I have given him for a Witneſs to the People, a Leader and Commander to the People.</hi> Acts 5. 31. <hi>Him hath God the Father exalted to be Prince and a Saviour.</hi> Pſal. 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Be wiſe, now therefore, O ye Kings; be inſtructed, ye Judges of the Earth: Serve the Lord with fear, rejoyce before him with trembling. Kiſs the Son, lest he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little.</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34102:22"/> ſaith, That the Servants of Chriſt are the honourableſt Men in the World, yea, that they are to be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double Honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17; yea, God himſelf doth Honour them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 30. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 15. and becauſe God honours them himſelf, therefore he makes them Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in the Eyes of others; yea, God hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Servants to be highly honoured in the Eyes of the Heathen and profeſſed Pagans, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 4. The Children of <hi>Heth,</hi> how highly were they made to Honour <hi>Abraham? Hear us my Lord, for thou art a mighty Prince amongst us, in the choice of our Sepulchers bury thy Dead.</hi> What a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Honour was there given to <hi>Joſeph</hi> by <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Gen. 41. 39, 42. <hi>And Pharaoh ſaid to Joſeph, Foraſmuch as God hath ſhewed thee all this, there is none ſo Diſcreet and Wiſe as thou art: And Pharaoh took off his Ring from his Hand, and put it upon Joſeph's Hand, and arrayed him with Veſtures of fine Linnen, and put a golden Chain about his Neck.</hi> So the like we read of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 Chron. 9. 23. <hi>And all the Kings of the Earth ſought the Preſence of Solomon to hear his Wiſdom, that God put into his Heart.</hi> The like we read of the Honour which <hi>Beiſhazzer,</hi> a Pagan, gave to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 5. 29. <hi>Then commanded Beiſhazzer, and they clothed Daniel with Scarlet, and put a Chain of Gold about his Neck, and made Proclamation concerning him, that he ſhould be the third Ruler in the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, though ſome baſe-ſpirited Men may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Servants of God, yet, when God pleaſeth, he can make the Wicked'ſt that are to Honour them at the higheſt rate; therefore, let the Opinion of the World be what it will, about the People of God, my Opinion is, and I hope ever will be, That it's far better, and a thouſand times more honourable to be a Servant of Chriſt in Rags, than to be the Devil's Slave, in the moſt glorious Royal Robes; and that the meaneſt Chriſtian (if Sincere) is far more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt mable, with Chriſt's Croſs upon his Back, than the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Monarch (if Graceleſs) with his Royal Crown upon his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next thing that the Prieſt was to do, was to dip his Finger in the Oil, and to apply it to the ſame Parts unto which the Bloud was applied before, which was firſt to the Ear, binding it to the Duty of hearing Chriſt's Voice,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34102:22"/> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 10. 27. Then to the Hand, binding it to the Duty of working Righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. Laſtly, To the Foot, binding of that to the Duty of Walking in the Ways of God's Commandments, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23. Thus, when all theſe parts of the Body were tipt with the Bloud of the Lamb, then the Oil was next to be applied to the ſame Parts. Oil (you know) is of a mollifying and ſoftning Nature: Oil is good to fetch off Ruſt from Clocks and Jacks, making them to go the more freely and nimbly, which, when clogg'd with Ruſt, became unſerviceable before; comparatively to the nature of Oil in this caſe, is the Uſefulneſs of Grace held forth in Scripture, <hi>Iſa. 1. 6. Thy Sores have not been cloſed, neither bound up, neither mollified with Ointment.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, they had no Grace (which here is compared to Oil) to Sanctifie their ulcerated corrupt Natures, which, like ſo many Plague-ſores, were continually iſſuing from them; with this Oil of Grace, the cleanſed Lepers of Chriſt were to have their Ears, Hands and great Toes of their right Feet anointed.</p>
               <p>From all which, we may obſerve this Note:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That as the Bloud of Christ hath bought us for his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Service, ſo the Oil of his Grace, is that only which can fit us for it, and make us willing to ſet about it,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. <hi>In the Day of my Power, thy People ſhall be a willing People: By Nature every Man is averſe to every part of Christ's Work and Service.</hi> Rom. 8. 7. <hi>The natural-minded Man is Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against God; it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> John 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that you might Live.</hi> Jer. 44. 16. <hi>As for the Word, which thou hast ſpoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ear will not hear the Voice of Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 10. the Hand will not Work for Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 7, 8. neither will the Feet walk in the Way of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 10. But now, when our High-Prieſt, Jeſus Chriſt, hath tipt the Ear, the Thumb, and Foot of our Souls, with the Oil of his Grace and Sanctification, then will they be ready for any Work and Service, which he ſhall employ them in, or call them unto; the Ear which was bought by Chriſt, is now taught by Chriſt to hear his Voice, even his Voice in his Word, Works, Ordinances and Providences, againſt all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34102:23"/> which, the Ear was deaf, and ſhut up before, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 4. The Hand which was bought by Chriſt, is now taught to Work for Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 13. 21. Working that which is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> Iſa. 54. 13. <hi>All her Chrildren are taught by the Lord.</hi> They are taught to work the Works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, Love, Self-denial, Mortification; how to be Praying to God, and Praiſing of God, Suffering for God, and to Walk with God; Grace teacheth all this, and makes the Heart willing to all this; the Spirit ſhall teach you all things, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. Laſtly, The Feet, which were bought by Chriſt, (by this Oil of Grace) are now taught to Walk with Chriſt, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did; <hi>And Enoch walked with God,</hi> Gen. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Reaſon of the Point:</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of all this is, becauſe Grace is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, ſubduing Nature, and of and inabling Quality; Grace is ſent down into the Heart, to ſubdue the Power and Strength of Sin therein, <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you, for you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> And as Grace ſubdues and weakens Corruption in the Heart, ſo it enables, ſtrengthens, and empowers the Heart to act for Chriſt; it is a holy Oil, that diſſolves the corrupt Ruſt which hath been begotten in it by Sin, and, as it diſſolves the Ruſt, ſo it mollifies and ſoftens the Heart, and thereby it makes it able and willing to run the Ways of God's Commandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 32. So <hi>Iſa. 40. 31. They ſhall renew their Strength, they ſhall mount up as on Eagles wings, they ſhall run and not be weary, walk and not be faint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> This informs us then, what matter of Lamentation it is to conſider, That though there be ſo many thouſand of Ears, Hands, and Feet in the World, yet that there ſhould be ſo few of them employed in the Service of Chriſt, that as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the Idols of the Nations, <hi>They have Ears, but hear not; Hands, but handle not, and Feet they have, but walk not.</hi> The Reaſon lieth here, Becauſe they never had their Ears, Hands and Feet, tipt with the Bloud and Oil of the Juſtifying and Sanctifying-grace of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>They are yet dead in their Sins and Treſpaſſes,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1. and dead things cannot act of themſelves; yea, they are not only unable to act for Chriſt, but through the Enmity of their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34102:23"/> Natures, they are wholly averſe to every part of Chriſt's Will and Work: As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, They are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to every good Work and Word; it is not only, they cannot, but the real Truth is, that graceleſs Souls will not act for Chriſt, if they could; let not ſuch deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any longer, for if you have no Ears to hear Chriſt's Voice, no Hands to do his Work, nor Feet to Walk in his Paths, you are yet in an unjuſtified and unſanctified State and Condition: But would you have your Ears opened to the Voice of Chriſt, ſo that your Souls might live? Would you have your Hands at Work for Chriſt, working that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight? Would you have your Feet made able and willing to run in God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? <hi>In the keeping of which, is great Reward,</hi> Pſal. 19. 11. then lay thy Soul in the Ways and Walks of Chriſt, who is the great High-Prieſt; Oh, run to him, ſet thy Soul in his preſence, be in his ſight, thruſt thy ſelf through the Croud and Throng, preſs in upon him, and evermore keep up the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Woman's Cry in his Ears, <hi>Matth. 15. 22. Lord, thou Son of David, have mercy upon me, for my Soul is grievouſly over-run with a Leproſie;</hi> thus, with <hi>Jacob,</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Wreſtling with him, until he hath tipt thy right Ear, Hand, and Foot, with the Bloud and Oil of his Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why was the Prieſt to tip the Leper's right Ear, right Thumb, and Toe of the right Foot, with the Bloud and Oil? Why the right more than the left Ear, Thumb, and Toe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Reaſon may be this, To ſignifie the difference betwixt the Services that Hypocrites and ſincere Chriſtians do offer to him, and do for him; all the Service that comes to him from Hypocrites, is but left-ear'd, left-handed, and left-footed Service, which is no way pleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But when may it be ſaid, that we give unto God this left-ear'd, left-handed, and left-footed Service?</p>
               <p>As, firſt, When are we ſaid to bring forth left-ear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, When we content our ſelves with the bear Hearing of his Will preached, neglecting the Practice of it; this is the Service of the left Ear; indeed, of ſuch a ſort of Hearers we read in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ezek. 33. 31. <hi>And they come unto thee as the People cometh, and ſit before thee as my</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:34102:24"/> 
                  <hi>People, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them; for with their Mouth they ſhew much Love, but their Hearts goeth after their Covetouſneſs.</hi> Not to anſwer the end of Hearing, which is Obedience, is as bad (if not worſe) than not to hear at all, <hi>Jam. 1. 22. But be ye Doers of the Word, and not Hearers only.</hi> We uſe to ſay, when Men give little At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to our Words of Diſcourſe, to them, That they turn the deaf Ear to us; and when we obſerve not what God ſpeaks to us, then do we give the deaf and left Ear unto him.</p>
               <p>2. But when may we be ſaid to give left-handed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, When we give him only partial Obedience, when we do but a part, and not the whole of his revealed Will; this kind of Service <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> gave to God, which was as unacceptable to God, as it was unprofitable to themſelves, as you may read, firſt, in King <hi>Saul, 1 Sam. 15. 11. It reponteth me that I have ſet up Saul, for he is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back from following me, and hath not performed my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: and it grieved Samuel, and he cried to the Lord all night.</hi> The Caſe was this, King <hi>Saul</hi> had a ſtrict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given to him from the Lord, to deſtroy the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi> not to ſpare Man, Woman, Child, nor Cattle, <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. It's true that <hi>Saul</hi> deſtroyed many Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſome of the Cattle, but he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and the beſt of the Sheep and Oxen, with the Farlings and Lambs, but every thing that was vile and refuſe, that he deſtroyed utterly, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9 Here was Obedience, ſuch as it was, but it was only left handed Obedience, becauſe it was but partial, and not univerſal Obedience; and, as <hi>Saul</hi>'s Covetouſneſs was the cauſe of this, ſo it is Men's unmortified Luſts, which proves the cauſe of the like partial Obedience in every Man elſe, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 15. Balaam loved the Wages of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond Inſtance, which the Scripture gives us of this left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed Obedience, is that of <hi>Johu, 2 Kings</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8, 9. ver. where you find, that he was anointed King, to deſtroy the whole Houſe of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> and all his wicked Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and, in purſuance of his Commiſſion, he cuts off <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>'s Fam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s off all his Idolatrous Prieſts and Worſhippers in <hi>Baal</hi>'s Houſe; but yet ſtill he muſt be partial in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34102:24"/> as <hi>Saul</hi> was in his, being under the power of the like unmortified Luſt, which held him back from doing the whole Will of God preſcribed to him in his Commiſſion, 2 <hi>Kings 10. 31. But Jehu took no heed to Walk in the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his Heart, for he departed not from the Sins of Jeroboam, which made Iſrael to Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may be ſaid to give the Lord left-handed Obedience, when we give him only bodily Service, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Heart, Will and Affections; and ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> this<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will not profit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. This kind of Service the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> gave to God in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 36, 37. they flattered God with their Mouths, and dealt deceitfully with him in their Hearts, neither were they ſteadfaſt in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Yet how do the moſt of Men take up, and reſt in a little bare out-ſide Work in external Performances, and quiet themſelves with a few Names and empty Titles? So they have a Name to live, and are called Chriſtians, and give unto God a little bodily Exerciſe, they are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, when all this is but left-handed Service and no more. Alas! theſe Chriſtian-names and Titles, ſeparated from the power of Godlineſs, they ſignifie no more than a parcel of fine ſweet, ſmelling Flowers deckt about the Body of a dead Corpſe, which, though they help to Garniſh the Dead, yet cannot they make a dead Body to live., O truſt not to theſe things, nor reſt in them, becauſe they are no more in the ſight of God, than a dead Body without a Soul is in our ſight, <hi>James 2. 26. For as the Body without the Soul is dead, ſo Faith without Works is dead alſo. For Circumciſion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the Commandments of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thridly, and laſtly,</hi> When may we be ſaid to give unto God left-foot Obedience?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, When we walk not ſteadfaſtly with him, when we are ſometimes for him, and ſometimes for <hi>Baal;</hi> ſometimes in his Worſhip, and ſometimes in the contrary, like thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Zeph.</hi>

If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal be God, follow him: How long will ye halt betwixt two Opinions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> We give unto God left-foot Obedience, when we walk at Random and not by Rule, when we ceaſe making the Scriptures our Guide, and inſtead thereof, we make the Traditions and Humane Inventions of Men (in the Matters of Faith) our Rule and Guide to walk by, <hi>Matt. 15. 9.

               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall acquaint you with five corrupt Rules, which the moſt of Men propoſe to themſelves, as their Guides to walk by in the Matters of their Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, in oppoſition to the Word of God, which indeed is the only Rule which all Men ought to Walk by, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First of all,</hi> Some walk by the rule of Cuſtom, which in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. the Apoſtle calls a walking after the Courſe of this World; many there are that do think, becauſe the moſt of Men do do ſo and ſo, therefore they may do ſo, and walk ſo too without the leaſt ſcruple; How common is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men to make this the Rule of their Lives, concluding that they are in a very ſafe condition, if they go that Way wherein the moſt do walk? This was the Way which the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34102:25"/> 
                  <hi>Jews</hi> choſe as their Rule to walk by, <hi>Jer. 44. 16, 17. As for the Word which thou hast ſpoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth of our own Mouth, to burn Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, as we have done, we, and our Fathers, our Kings, and our Princes, in the Cities of Judah, and in the Streets of Jeruſalem.</hi> But for Men to make the Ways and Walks of the Multitude their Rule and Guide to Walk by, muſt needs be a very unſafe and dangerous Rule; it is to walk after a wicked World, as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>John 5. 19. The whole World lieth in Wickedneſs.</hi> Chap. 2.

                  <hi>2dly,</hi> A ſecond unſound Rule which Men chuſe to Walk by, is Antiquity, to do as their Fore-fathers have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; this is, and hath been a wonderful prevailing Argument with many of the ignorant Sort in the World: What, ſhall we think our ſelves wiſer than our Fore-fathers?

                  <hi>4thly,</hi> Others there are which make their own perverſe ſtubborn Wills, their Rule to walk by, they will do what they will do, they will have their Luſts, they will have their Pleaſures, they will fulfil the Deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind, let God, his Word, and Miniſters ſay what they will againſt it: This was the Rule which <hi>Ephraim</hi> made choice of to Walk by, in deſpight of all the Convictions which the Prophet brought to the contrary, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 5. For ſhe ſaid, I will go after my Lovers that gave me my Bread, my Water, my Wool, my Flax, my Oil, and my Drink.</hi> The like Wilfulneſs was found in the Hearts of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the Will of God, <hi>Jer. 44. 25. Thus ſaith the Lord of Host, the God of Iſrael, ſaying, ye and your Wives have both ſpoken with your Mouths, and have fulfilled it with your Hands, ſaying, We will ſurely perform our Vows that we have made, to burn Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out our Drink-offerings to her; ye will ſurely accompliſh your Vows.</hi> Mark, how the Lord takes notice of their Wilfulneſs, no leſs than twice in this Verſe, you will fulfil your Vows, and you will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the Promiſes which you have made to your Idols, you will do it, you are wilfully bent upon it, and, inaſmuch, as you are ſo wilful in your Reſolutions, I am reſolved to be as wilful on my part in your Deſtruction, and then it ſhall be known whoſe Word ſhall ſtand, either mine or yours, ver. 27, 28. Thus you ſee what a dangerous thing it is for Men to make their Wills their Rule to walk by, eſpecially when we conſider how oppoſite the Will of Man is (by Nature) to the Will and Word of God, <hi>John 5. 40.

The Prophet that hath a Dream, let him tell a Dream; and he that hath my Word, let him ſpeak my Word faithfully. What is the Chaff to the Wheat?

               <p>It is a very dangerous thing, when Perſons, through their ſlighting of the written Word, ſhall thereby provoke God to give them over to wander after theſe ſatanical Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe (many times) what Ways Men do ſinfully chuſe to walk in, and deluded Rules to walk by, the ſame Ways and Rules God will judicially chuſe for them, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 10, 11, 12. Becauſe they received not the Truth in the Love of it, that they might be ſaved; for this Cauſe, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſions, to believe Lies, that they might be damned.</hi> Therefore have we that Rule given us in <hi>Iſa. 8. 20.

               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> We give unto God left-footed Service, when we walk not conſtantly with him, when we are off and on with God, when we play faſt and looſe with God; ſome there are, when affrighted by ſtrong Convictions, and grieved by and with ſore Afflictions, will then for a fit be Religious, then they will Pray and Read good Books, and frequent the Worſhip of God, and ſet about the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of religious Duties in their Families; but when the ſenſe of the Conviction is abated, and the ſmart of their Affliction a little worn off, then, like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> all their

Nevertheleſs they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered him with their Mouth, and lied unto him with their Tongues, for their Hearts were not right with him, neither were they ſtedfast in his Covenant.</hi> This inconſtant Service was never yet acceptable Service with God, nor will it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be eſteemed otherwiſe than left-footed Service offered unto him.</p>

                  <hi>4thly,</hi> When we walk not ſincerely with God, then we give him left and not right-footed Service; this was the Service <hi>Amazia</hi> gave to the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron. 25. 2.

So that you ſee there is Truth and Uprightneſs in the Lord towards us, and he expects to find the ſame in us towards himſelf again: Truth is the Nature of God, and he cannot but hate the contrary, where-ever he ſees it: let Men clothe themſelves with never ſo much out-ſide Holineſs, yet if Truth and Sincerity be found wanting, all is but glittering Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the Eyes of God, <hi>Rev. 3. 1. Thou hast a Name to live, and art dead.</hi> The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had as much of an outward Holineſs upon them as moſt Men living, but their want of Sincerity, turned all their painted ſhew of Holineſs into perfect Rottenneſs, in the Eyes of Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 27. It's not the Matter of our Services only, which commends us to God, but the Manner of our performing of them: If our Ends and Aims <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Truth of this Obſervation is atteſted both by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Father alſo: <hi>First,</hi> By Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John 17. 4.

                  <hi>2dly,</hi> This Truth is alſo witneſſed unto by the Father, as well as by the Son, <hi>Iſa. 53. 10, 11. He ſhall prolong his Days, and the Pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his Hands; he ſhall ſee of the Travel of his Soul and be ſatisfied:</hi> That is, the Father ſhall ſee his Son's Work finiſhed to his full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Now the Reaſon of the Point is this, Becauſe Chriſt was God as well as Man, and becauſe he is ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wanteth no Sufficiency to accompliſh whatever he takes in hand, nor never yet did he begin any Work, but he always finiſh'd it before he left it: He made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth, and he did it compleatly; he made Man upon the Earth, and made a perfect Piece of him; and when he had finiſhed his whole Work, he beheld it, and it was very good, good for Matter, and good for the Form of it, and the ending of it was a glorious Work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1. hence, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32. 4. <hi>His Work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> So that this is the Reaſon that a Believer's Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sanctification is ſo compleat and perfect, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was carried on by Jeſus Chriſt, who is very God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34102:29"/> as well as very Man, and there is nothing too hard for the Lord.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to Application:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Let this ſerve for Comfort to the doubting People of God, who are very apt to be dejected and caſt down in their Spirits; their Doubt is not ſo much, whether Chriſt were able to finiſh the Work of Juſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for them, that's put beyond Queſtion with them, but their Trouble ariſeth from their Darkneſs as to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this Juſtification, and the Littleneſs (if they have any at all) of the Grace of Sanctification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to their Darkneſs about their Intereſt in this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; many there are, becauſe they cannot read the Lines of their Juſtification upon the Book of their, own Conſciences, are apt to fear whether it were ever written for them upon the Book of Chriſt's Records in Heaven.</p>
               <p>There be three things, which makes ſome Chriſtians to doubt about their Intereſt in their Juſtification: <hi>1st,</hi> A ſight of old Sins upon the Book of their Conſciences. <hi>2dly,</hi> A natural Proneneſs to commit new Sins. <hi>3dly,</hi> A want of Skill to diſtinguiſh between the old Reckoning, as it ſtands upon the Book of God's Accounts, and as it ſtands upon the Memory and Conſcience of the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First of all,</hi> The ſight, of old Sins, as they ſtand upon the Book of their Conſciences; They think, becauſe the ſenſe of Sin remains upon their Conſciences uncancelled, therefore the guilt of Sin muſt needs remain upon the Book of God above unpardoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But this doth not always follow, but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For where Sin is unpardoned, there the Heart (as to the ſenſe of it) is moſtly hardned: Look over all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified Men which you can find in Scripture, and you will find, none more under the Conſcience of Sin, than thoſe who were truly Pardoned and Juſtified from their Sins, as <hi>David,</hi> though <hi>Nathan</hi> told him that his Sin was pardoned, yet how did the ſenſe of it bleed in his Conſcience, <hi>Pſal. 51. 2, 3. Waſh me throughly from my Iniquity, and cleanſe me from my Sin; for I acknowledge my Tranſgreſſions, and my Sin is ever before me.</hi> The like we find in <hi>Job,</hi> though God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf teſtified of him, that he was a pardoned Man, one that feared God, and eſchewed Evil, yet how did <hi>Job</hi> charge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34102:29"/> home the Guilt of Sin upon his own Conſcience, <hi>Job 13. 23. How many are my Iniquities and Sins, make me to know my Tranſgreſſion and my Sin.</hi> So good <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. 15. <hi>I am afflicted and ready to Die; while I ſuffer thy Terrours, I am Diſtracted.</hi> So that this ſhould rather be thy Cordial than a Corroſive to thee, that with thoſe good Men, the ſenſe of Sin is made to viſit thy Conſcience: A ſenſe of Sin is neceſſary to help on Repentance, Repentance is the Fruit of a juſtified State, <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Moreover, whom he did Predeſtinate, them he alſo Called,</hi> (that is by Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) <hi>and whom he Called, them he alſo Juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A ſecond Ground of doubting in Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Juſtification, ariſeth from their Proneneſs in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to commit new Sins: Certainly, ſaith a doubting Soul, if I were ever Juſtified from the Guilt of my Sins, I ſhould never be ſo apt to commit Sin as I do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is one thing to have the guilt of Sin acquitted to the Soul, and another thing to have the filth of Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the Soul, the one belongs to Chriſt's Juſtifying, and the latter to Chriſt's Sanctifying Grace; the Act of Chriſt's Juſtifying of the Soul is done at once, upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act of the Soul's believing, <hi>Acts 13. 39. By him all that do Believe, are Juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be Juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> But the Act of Chriſt's Sanctifying a Soul, is done by degrees, and is a Work of Time; ſo that a Soul may be fully Juſtified from all his Sins, and yet the Nature very prone to commit it; <hi>Paul</hi> had no cauſe to doubt of his Juſtification, yet he deeply complains of his readineſs and proneneſs, <hi>Rom. 7. 21. I find a Law in my Members, that when I would do Good, Evil is preſent with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this difference bewixt a Juſtified and an Unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified Man's Inclination to Sin; a Juſtified Man always Sins with Reluctancy, but the other with Allowance; the Juſtified Man is ever renewing his State by Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Pſal. 51. 1, 2, 3, 4. And the other is adding of Sin to Sin without Repentance.</hi> Jer. 8. 6. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but they ſpake not aright; no Man repented him of his Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Every one turned to his Courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battle.</hi> Sin is ſqueezed forth from a Juſtified Man, but it comes freely without let
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34102:30"/> or hindrance from the other: Now look into thy Heart, though thy ſinful Nature works in thee, yet is it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret? Is it with due Repentance? Doth it not come freely from thee? Is it the Evil thou wouldſt not do, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, and doth it oftentimes make thee to cry out as he did in <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretched Man that I am; who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> Then doubt not, becauſe thou haſt no more reaſon to queſtion thy Juſtification than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Heman, Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> had.</p>
               <p>The third Ground of a Chriſtian's doubting about his Juſtified Condition, ariſeth from his want of Skill, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt the old Reckoning, as it ſtands upon the Book of God's Accounts, and as it ſtands upon the Book of God's Accounts, and as it ſtands upon the Book of his own Conſcience: It is juſt with ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as it is with ſome ignorant Servant, who is ſent to a Shop-keeper to buy ſuch and ſuch Commodities; the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper ſets it all down in his Shop-book, the next Week the Servant comes and diſchargeth the Debt, the Week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the ſame Servant comes again for new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, the Shop-keeper books down all again as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but as the Shop-keeper is writing down of the new Debt, the Servant looking over his ſhoulder, eſpies the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of the old Reckoning upon the Book, which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged before; this ſends the Servant away with a Heart loaded with Grief and Trouble, fearing that the Debt (which he had diſcharged) will be demanded again. It's true, he ſaw ſome ſtrokes croſt over the Particulars upon the Book, but being wholly ignorant that the croſſing of the Book was a full Diſcharge of the Debt in Law, this keeps the poor Servant under his Fear and Trouble ſtill. Thus ſtands the Matter with many a doubting Chriſtian about their Juſtification, though the Book of Accounts in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be diſcharged and croſt above, with the red ſtrokes of the Bloud of Chriſt, the Vertue of which diſchargeth the whole in Law, 1 <hi>John 1. 7. The Bloud of Jeſus Christ clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Yet the Soul being unaquainted with this Myſtery, he beholding the Items ſtanding yet upon his own Conſcience, thinks that the whole Debt is ſtill to be exacted from him, as if there had never been any Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made for his Debt at all: But, O doubting Soul! if thou wouldſt have Peace in thy Soul, thy Work muſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34102:30"/> be to acquaint thy ſelf with the nature of a Believer's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge (as to his Debt) in the Court of Heaven above: Labour, by an Eye of Faith, to ſee the red Strokes of Chriſt's Bloud, with which the grand Book above is croſt for thee for ever; and then whatever the Items are which ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Book of thy Conſcience, yet they can do thee no hurt, becauſe now they ſignifie nothing againſt thee in Law, <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34. Who ſhall condemn? It is God that Juſtifies. Who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is Christ that Died.</hi> So that you plainly ſee, that God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a Believer upon the account of Chriſt's Death, the Bloud of whoſe Death, diſchargeth his Debt, and gives ſuch a Satisfaction to the Law of God, that nothing can condemn the Soul for ever; thus you ſee what theſe Doubts are, which do darken a Chriſtian's Intereſt in his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and alſo the Grounds and Reaſons from whence theſe Doubts and Fears do ariſe: But here lieth thy Comfort, Chriſt thy High-Prieſt hath compleated this Work for thee, though thou canſt not apprehend thy Intereſt in it, by a clear ſight of Faith, yet he by one Offering, hath perfected this Work for thee, and that for ever, if thou be truly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14.</p>

Oh! if I have any Grace at all, yet it is ſo little, I fear it will never laſt long, and ſo I ſhall never be able to hold out: Oh! my Faith in God, my Love to God, my Zeal for God, my Sincerity before God, my Patience under Trials, my Self-denial and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo little, that I fear all my Religion will end in meer Formality, and my Profeſſion conclude in Hypocriſie when all is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Oh! Soul, againſt all theſe Fears, thy Duty is to look up to Jeſus Chriſt, who is thy myſtical Head, and in him thou ſhalt ſee thy Soul compleatly Sanctified as well as compleatly Juſtified; I do not ſay, that Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Work of Sanctification in a Believer's own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, while in this Life; No, no, while a Believer is in the Body, the Fleſh will be luſting againſt the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and Believers again through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34102:31"/> of the Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. which is one ſpecial part of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: And, further, I do not ſay, that the Spirit in his working of Mortification, doth ſo kill and ſubdue Sin in Believers, as that it ſhall never trouble, grieve or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file them more; No, that Freedom belongs to the perfect State in Heaven; but though Chriſt hath not perfected this Work in a Believer, yet Chriſt hath perfected Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in himſelf for the Believer. Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>But of him, are ye in Christ Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It muſt be acknowledged, that (by Nature) thou art in thy ſelf a Fool, <hi>Luke 24. 25. O Fools, and ſlow of heart to believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is as true, that thou haſt no Righteouſneſs of thy own, <hi>Iſa. 64. 6. We are all as an unclean Thing, our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is as filthy Rags.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou art by Nature a perfect Slave and Vaſſel to Sin and the Devil, therefore is Chriſt ſaid to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, even to ſuch as thou art, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And it is as true, that thou art as void of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <hi>Ezek. 16. 6. When I paſſed by thee, I ſaw thee pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in thy own Bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now thou ſeeſt that Chriſt is made over to thee by God the Father, to be Wiſdom for thy Fooliſhneſs, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for thy Raggedneſs, Sanctification for thy Polluted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Redemption for thy Slavery; he is all this in the ſight of God for thee, and he looks upon thee, as if thou wert all this in thy ſelf for his Son's ſake, unto whom thou art united by Faith. What if thou feeleſt in thy ſelf but thy right Ear, thy right Thumb, and Toe of thy right Foot tipt with the Oil of Sanctification, yet be not diſcouraged, it is enough that the Perfection of it is in Chriſt, thy Head, for thee, and in God's Account? This is as well as if it were in thy ſelf and better too, and God accounts it as thine, and imputes it to thee for thy own upon thy believing, and would have thee to reckon it ſo for thy Comfort and Conſolation, <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves to be dead indeed unto Sin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi> (Mark,) To be Dead unto Sin is a part of the Perfection of our Sanctification.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:34102:31"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But can a Man be Dead unto Sin in this Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's true, no Man is ſo himſelf, yet in his Head, Chriſt, he is ſo, therefore would God have a Believer to reckon it, as if he were ſo in himſelf; for ſo much ſeems to me to be manifeſtly handed out to us in <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. about Cleanſing the Leper, if we compare the 14 with the 18 Verſe of that Chapter; for in Ver. 14. there you have our Saviour in the Perſon of the High-Prieſt, (or any other of the levitical Prieſts) Sanctifying of the ſpiritual Leper, which was ſhadowed out in the Perſon of the corporal Leper; and in the 18 Ver. there you have Chriſt in the Perſon of the Prieſt, Sanctifying of himſelf, for the ſpiritual Leper, who Believes in him. Mark the Words, <hi>Ver. 18. And the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Oil, that is in the Priest's Hand, he ſhall pour it out upon the Head of him that is to be Cleanſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, firſt, let us ſee what light the 14 Ver. will afford us in this Matter, for, in this Verſe, you have Chriſt in the the Perſon of the Prieſt, Sanctifying of the believing Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and, in that Act, you may ſee that the Work was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfectly done, only the Tip or Lap of the right Ear, the Thumb of the right Hand, and the great Toe, and that done too but with the tip of his Finger dipt in Oil, which could not carry home much of the Oil to either part, yet the Prieſt was to ſprinkle the reſt of the Oil, which was upon the top of his Finger, ſeven times before the Lord; which number, amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (as we have told you before) was accounted a number of Perfection; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſprinkling ſeven times before the Lord, was as much as to ſay, O Lord, the Work which is done upon the Leper, is perfect Work, it is a Work compleatly done: So that though there be no more than an Ear, Thumb, and Toe of the ſpiritual Leper tipt with the Oil of Grace and Sanctification, yet it being true Grace, therefore the Work is perfect Work, perfect for Parts though not for Degrees: So that, in a ſenſe, as low and little as the Grace and Sanctification ſeems to be in thy Soul, yet it may be ſaid to be Perfect, and that in this double reſpect:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> With reſpect to the Parts of the Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> With reſpect to the Quality of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For thy low Meaſure of Sanctification, as low and little as it ſeems to be, yet it is Perfect with reſpect to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34102:32"/> Parts of it: A Child which is but a Day old, may be ſaid to be a perfect Man for his Parts, though yet he is not ſo for Degrees; for he hath all the Parts and Members of a Man; the Father that begat him, who far exceeds it for quantity, yet hath he not one Limb more in his Body than the Child hath. So it is as true in this ſpiritual Caſe, the ſtrongeſt Believer under Heaven, who hath made the greateſt Improvement of his Grace, hath not one Grace more than the leaſt Saint on Earth. In a word, Chriſt himſelf hath not one Grace in him more than the weakeſt Believer on Earth; this we grant, That he hath more Grace than the greateſt Believer ever had, or all the Saints and Angels in Heaven have, put them all together, for Grace was poured into him without meaſure; but for the number of Graces, there are no more in Chriſt than in the weakeſt Saint; for you read in <hi>John 1. 16. That of his Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sanctification in Believers may be ſaid to be Perfect for the quality of it; as little as thy Grace in thee ſeems to be, yet for what there is of it, it is as perfect as is the greateſt Meaſure of Grace in the talleſt Saint in the World; as a ſpark of Fire is as true Fire for the quality of it, as that is which makes the greateſt Blaze; a drop of Water is as perfect Water as is the whole Ocean or Sea; a little piece of Gold, though but to the value of Six-pence in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet, for the quality of it, it is as perfect Gold, as a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which amounts to a Talent in weight; ſo the leaſt degree of Grace, is as perfect for the quality of it, as where there is the greateſt quantity: So that, by this you may perceive, that in this ſenſe, the Work of Sanctification may be ſaid to be Perfect in the weakeſt Believers, who are therefore counted perfect Men, though otherwiſe made up of their Failings and great Infirmities, as you read of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6. 9. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 21. So <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the third Chapter. So <hi>David,</hi> Acts 13. 22. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. So <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 20. 3. compared with 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 32. 25. And in this ſenſe our Saviour is to be underſtood in <hi>Matt. 5. 48. Be ye therefore Perfect, as your heavenly Father is Perfect;</hi> who means by Perfectneſs in this place, a labouring after Grace in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Reality of it, in oppoſition to Hypocrifie: So then,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34102:32"/> if thy Grace be but true Grace, and thy Sanctification be real and not fained, though it be but as a grain of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard-ſeed, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 6. this declares thee in a Goſpel Senſe to be a perfect Believer. Thus we have diſpatch'd the firſt Particular, which relates to Chriſt's Sanctifying the ſpiritual Leper, which he ſhadowed out to us in the Perſon of the Levitical Prieſt's Cleanſing of the corporal Leper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We next come to ſpeak of Chriſt's Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of himſelf for the ſpiritual cleanſed Leper: The Light we have into it, ſprings out of the 18 Verſe, <hi>And the remnant of the Oil that is in the Prieſt's Hand, he ſhall pour upon the Head of him that is to be Cleanſed.</hi> Suitable to this, is that Paſſage of our Saviour, <hi>John 17. 19. For their ſakes I Sanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo may be Sanctified through the Truth.</hi> Saith the <hi>Aſſemblies Annotations</hi> upon it, Chriſt did it by a voluntary Dedication and Conſecration of himſelf, as an unblemiſhed Sacrifice for his People: But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture further tells us, That Chriſt's being Sanctified for his People, is meant his receiving a Fulneſs of Grace for them, that with that Fulneſs they might be made Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious alſo, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14, with 16 Ver. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt amongst us, and we beheld his Glory, as the Glory of the only Begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth, that of his Fulneſs we might receive, and Grace for Grace.</hi> Now who is it that the Scripture calls the Head of every ſpiritual cleanſed Leper? Is it not Jeſus Chriſt? 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 3. The Head of every Man is Christ.</hi> Col. 1. 18. <hi>And he is the Head of the Body, the Church.</hi> Epheſ. 5. 23. <hi>Even as Christ is the Head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Oil which was to be applied to the Head of the cleanſed Leper, that, was not to be given out in a few Drops with the tip of the Prieſt's Finger, as it was to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's Ear, Thumb and great Toe, as before, no but when the Oil comes to be applied unto the Head of him that was to be Cleanſed; here it was to be poured out without meaſure, <hi>And the Remnant of the Oil in the Prieſt's Hand, he ſhall pour it upon the Head of him that is to be Cleanſed,</hi> Ver. 18. Hence the Scripture, ſpeaking of Chriſt the Head of his cleanſed Lepers, tells you, That he received not the Spirit by Meaſure, <hi>John 3. 34. And that it pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34102:33"/> that in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1. 19. <hi>And that he was full of Grace and Truth,</hi> John 1. 14. <hi>And he was anointed with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fellows,</hi> Pſal. 45. 7. <hi>And that Grace was poured into his Lips,</hi> Ver. 2. So that this Fulneſs of the Oil of Grace, which was poured out upon Chriſt, the Head of Believers, this dwells in Chriſt for them upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Fruit of it, which was his Obedience, might be imputed to them for their Juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Grace of it might be imparted to them for their Sanctification, as far as they need it, and he ſees good to impart it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First of all,</hi> That Chriſt's Obedience unto Righteouſneſs (which was the Fruit of his Anointing) might be imputed to Believers for their Juſtification, <hi>Rom. 5. 18. Even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the Free-gift came upon all Men unto Juſtification of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it might be imparted unto Believers for their Sanctification, <hi>John 1. 16. Of his Fulneſs, we have all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> Both of theſe two Benefits <hi>Paul</hi> ſums up together in one Verſe, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Who of God is made unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> ſuppoſing that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were inveſted with theſe two ſaving Benefits; now, ſaith <hi>Paul, Ye are Compleat in him,</hi> Col. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee where a Believer's Perfection lieth as to his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, it lieth and liveth in Chriſt their Head; hence then, when Satan ſhall raiſe Objections againſt thee, labouring thereby to diſcourage thy Soul, from the lowneſs and littleneſs of thy Sanctification, then reply to him as a Man would do to thoſe who upbraid him with the courſe Clothes which he wears on his Back, he is ready to anſwer them, O ye Deſpiſers, did you know the rich and coſtly Rayment which I have at Home, you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſpiſe me as you do for the Clothes I now wear. So, poor drooping Soul, reply to Satan in like manner, What though the Sanctification which dwells in me, be both low and little, yet I have better Clothes than theſe laid up in Chriſt for me: Look not ſo much upon the Habit which I wear my ſelf, but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the glorious Robes of Chriſt my Head, and behold the rich Clothing he appears in, at the Father's right hand for me; all this is mine, and for my Uſe, to be put on by me when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time is come, for then, <hi>Phil. 3. 21. He changes our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> This was it which cauſed the Spouſe to hold up Heart and Head above Water, in oppoſition to all the Diſcouragements
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34102:33"/> that the Malice of Hell could caſt into her about the littleneſs of her Sanctification, <hi>Cant 1. 5. Though I am black, yet comely, O ye Daughters of Jeruſalem, as the Tents of Kedar, and the Curtains of Solomon:</hi> That is, though ſhe were black with Affliction and Perſecution, for which the World derided her; and though ſhe were black in her ſelf with Corruption, for which the Devil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt her, yet ſhe ſtill comforted her ſelf with what ſhe was in Chriſt; there ſhe was more comely than the Curtains of <hi>Solomon:</hi> And the ſame Teſtimony Chriſt gives of all his cleanſed Lepers, <hi>Cant. 4. 7. Thou art all Fair, my Love, there is no Spot, in thee.</hi> In a word, as little as that Grace is which ſeems to be in thee, yet the Scripture calls it glorious Grace, <hi>Pſal. 45. 13. The King's Daughter is all glorious within, her Clothing is of wrought Gold.</hi>

               <p>1ſt <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> The Reaſon of the Point lieth here, becauſe this was one ſpecial Purpoſe of Chriſt in ſatisfying the Law for us, and thereby in reconciling of his Father to us, it was, that Sin might be deſtroyed in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. with <hi>Rom, 6. 6. For when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.

               </p>
               <p>2d <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> It muſt be ſo, becauſe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and intended, that every one of his Redeemed and Cleanſed Lepers, ſhould hold a holy Communion with himſelf, both in the Life that now is, and in the Life which is to come, <hi>John 14. 20, 21. At that Day ye ſhall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you; and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him. and I will manifest my ſelf to him.</hi> Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might Redeem us from all Iniquity, and Purifie to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</hi> Chriſt is the Prince of Purity, his Eyes are Eyes of Purity, that cannot look upon Iniquity; his Nature is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Purity, he is called the <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hoſts, whoſe Glory filleth the whole Earth,</hi> Iſa. 6. 3. therefore he cannot live in an impure Heart, nor have communion with impure Souls that are no way waſhed from their Iniquities.

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to the Malady, you may obſerve theſe things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Diſeaſe it ſelf. <hi>2dly.</hi> The Signs of the Diſeaſe. <hi>3dly,</hi> What the Inhabitant was to do upon the breaking forth of the Diſeaſe: And, <hi>4thly,</hi> The Reaſons of his ſo doing: And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Application upon the Point: But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Here you have the Diſeaſe of the Houſe ſpoken of in the firſt place, and that is a Leproſie, which was a contagious Pollution, an unclean Infection, dangerous to the Inhabitants dwelling in it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 34. <hi>And when ye be come into the Land of Canaan, which I give to you for a Poſſeſſion, and I put the Plague of Leproſie in a Houſe, of the Land of your Poſſeſſion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have the SIgns of the Houſe-leproſie, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by theſe Notes: as, When it appeared in deep Spots, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh or greeniſh in the Walls of the Houſe; and if they were lower than the Wall, (that is, if the Spots were fretted deeper than the Wall,) then was it to be counted a real Leproſie, as Ver. 37 ſheweth; which litteral or material Houſe, with this Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution cleaving to it, may fairly figure out thoſe ſpiritual Houſes or Goſpel-churches, which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ever had in this World; which while they are in this Life, they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubject to their ſpiritual Leproſies, Defilement and Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of Sin; and, that this may the better appear, it will be neceſſary to conſider the Reſemblance which the Scripture gives betwixt a material Houſe, and a well-conſtituted Goſpel-Church of Jeſus Chriſt: As,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In a material Houſe there are the Foundation-ſtones, ſo there is the ſame belonging to the Churches of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To a material Houſe there belongs the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which upholds all the reſt of the Building, ſo there is in the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In a material Houſe there are rows of Stones laid up upon the Foundation-ſtones, ſo it is in the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In a material Houſe, all the Timber-work which hath been fitted and framed for the Building, is all laid up, and coupled together, ſo it is with the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They agree alſo for Deſign and Purpoſe, becauſe the Deſign of Building a material Houſe, is for a Habitation to live in, ſo are the Churches of Chriſt appointed for the like purpoſe, even to the Habitations for Chriſt to dwell in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 22. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. Thus, as the Scripture gives you the Reſemblance betwixt a temporal Houſe, and the Churches of Chriſt, ſo alſo doth it give the ſame Denomination to Chriſt's Churches, calling them Houſes and Habitations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo Moſes was faithful in all his Houſe; but this Man was counted worthy of more Honour than Moſes, inaſmuch as he who hath builded the Houſe hath more Honour than the Houſe.</hi> So Ver. 6. <hi>But Christ as a Son over his own Houſe, whoſe Houſe are we, if we hold fast our Confidence, and the rejoycing of the Hope firm unto the end.</hi> Thus you ſee how the Scripture makes a temporal Houſe and the Churches of Chriſt to agree, both for Name and Subſtance.</p>
               <p>From all which we ſhall note theſe two Obſervations:</p>
               <p>1ſt Doct. <hi>That the ſpiritual Houſes or Churches of Jeſus Christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:34102:36"/> 
                  <hi>are ſubject to great Defilement and Pollution while in this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2d Doct <hi>That the Defilement and Pollution, which the Churches of Christ are ſubject unto in this Life, is many times very open and viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1ſt Doct. <hi>That the ſpiritual Houſes and Churches of Jeſus Christ are ſubject to great Defilement and Pollution while in this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this firſt Obſervation, I ſhall, <hi>First,</hi> prove the Point. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Give the Reaſons of it. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſame by wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For the Proof of it, you will find that this was the Caſe of Chriſt's old Teſtament-church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Ah! ſinful Nation, a People laden with Iniquity, a Seed of evil Doers, Children that are Corrupters; they have forſaken the Lord, they have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the holy One of Iſrael to Anger, they are gone away backward.

                     </gap> ſhould ye be ſtriken any more? Ye will revolt more and more; the whole Head is ſick, and the whole Heart is faint: From the Sole of the Foot, even unto the Head, there is no Soundneſs in it, but Wounds, and Bruiſes, and putrifying Sores; they have not been cloſed, neither bound up, nor modified with Ointment.</hi> The like we read hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Chriſt's Goſpel-churches, we read of an inceſtuous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement, and ſacramental Pollution which broke out in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 1. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 21, 22. We read of the Defilement of Fornication, which broke forth in the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> yea, and the Pollution of Idolatry too, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14. We read of the Pollution of falſe Doctrine, which broke forth in the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Rev. 2. 20. And alſo we read of the Defilement of carnal Security, which hapned to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 1. and of the Pollution of a luke-warm Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which cleaved to the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> Rev. 3. 16. Laſtly, Do not we likewiſe read how the Gallatian Church was corrupted and defiled in the Doctrine of it, confounding the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by Faith, with their own perſonal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. with Chap. 4. 21. Thus you ſee the Point proved by clear Scripture-evidence; and ſo we come to the Reaſons of it:</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon may be taken from the Miniſters of the Churches; and, Secondly, From the Churches themſelves.</p>
               <p>But, firſt of all, The Pollution and Defilement of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt, many times do ariſe from the ſleepy Drowſineſs of the Miniſters and Guides of the ſame. We read that a Miniſter's ſleepy Seaſon is the Devil's ſeeding Seaſon; whiles the Miniſter ſnores in his Sleep, then is the Devil's Seaſon to ſow his Seed, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 25. <hi>But while Men ſlept, his Enemy came and ſowed Tares among the Wheat, and went his way.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:34102:36"/>
               <p>This was the Unhappineſs of the Church of God in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Days, to be given over to the Conduct of an ignorant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy ſleepy Miniſtry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10. <hi>His Watchmen are Blind, they are all Ignorant, they are all dumb Dogs, they cannot bark, ſleeping, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, loving to Slumber; yea, they are greedy Dogs, which can never have enough, and they are Shepherds that cannot underſtand, they all look to their own way, every one for his Gain from his quarter.</hi> Hence it is, that, though we read of ſo much Corruption break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth upon the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet the Ground and Cauſe of it (in ſome Meaſure) was charged upon the Miniſters of thoſe Churches, which were called the Angels of the ſame; when Miniſters are given up to an idle lazy Life, to be remiſs in nothing more than in and about their Duty to God and the Souls of their People, no wonder if their Hearers do decline and wither, as to the Spirit, Life, and Power of Godlineſs under their Hands. Miniſters are called Phyſicians, and you know when a Phyſician grows careleſs and negligent in his Office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Patient, no wonder if the Body of ſuch a Patient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with corrupting Humours, and the Malignity of their old Diſtempers returns back upon them again: He that reads the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Paſtors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10, 11, 12. need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Corruption, which is expreſt in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A ſecond Ground of the Churches Corruption, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from the earthly-mindedneſs of their Miniſters; when Miniſters, through Covetouſneſs, ſhall make Merchandize of the Souls of their Hearers, and ſet their everlaſting Happineſs to ſale, to fill their Treaſures with worldly Gain, I mean, when they ſhall mind more their own worldly Wealth, than their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſpiritual Health; this opens a Door to let in bad Diſeaſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their People, it is a very rare thing to find a Miniſter gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Churches Wealth in worldly things, and the People to grow ſpiritually Wealthy under ſuch a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A third Ground ariſeth from the Debauchery and bad Lives of Miniſters, this excludes the Preſence of God, and his Bleſſing from their Labours, and leaves a Curſe in the room of it; ſuch a Miniſter may Preach until he hath preach'd out his Heart, before he ſhall do any good upon his People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 14, 32. <hi>I have ſeen alſo in the Prophets of Jeruſalem an horrible thing, they commit Adultery, and walk in Lies, they ſtrengthen alſo the Hands of Evil-doers, that none doth return from his Wickedneſs, they are all unto me as Sodom and the Inhabitants of Gomorrah.</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>They cauſe my People to err by their Lies and by their Lightneſs, yet I ſent them not, nor commanded them, therefore they ſhall not profit this People at all, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:34102:37"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A fourth Ground ariſeth from the Superſtitiouſneſs of a Miniſter; when the blind Zeal of a Miniſter ſhall incline him to a greater eagerneſs to promote the Superſtition of the Church, than faithfully to promote the pure Inſtitutions of Chriſt, woe to that People which lives under the Charge of ſuch a Man, <hi>Matt. 15. 8, 9. Ye Hypocrites, well did Eſaias Propheſie of you, ſaying, This People draweth nigh unto me with their Mouth, and honour me with their Lips, but their Heart is far from me; but in vain they do Worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reaſons are alſo drawn from the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that there is ſo much Corruption amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First of all,</hi> It ariſeth from their Negligence in not exerciſing of their Faith in the hearing of the Word, <hi>Heb. 4. 2. For unto us the Goſpel was preached as well as unto them, but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ariſeth from a Peoples not receiving the Truth in the Love of it; when a People ſhall rather hear the Word to pleaſe their Fancy, than to feed their Faith, when they ſhall hear more to get Head-notions, than warm Affections, or to grow in Gifts rather than to grow in Grace, let ſuch beware of that fearful Judgment ſpoken of in 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 10, 11, 12. Becauſe they received not the Love of the Truth that they might be ſaved; and for this cauſe, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſions, that they ſhould believe a Lie, that they all might be damned who believe not the Truth, but had pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark, There was a receiving of the Truth, but not to a right end, many there are, and but too too many, which are ſick of this Diſeaſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To hear much and read much, to increaſe their Parts, but not their Piety, to be admired of Men rather than to be approved of God; but when Men from a Spirit of Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory attend the Miniſtry of the Word, but not aiming at the Glory of God, wonder not if ſuch Mens Knowledge prove at laſt like the Wilderneſs-manna to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It ariſeth from the Peoples Unfruitfulneſs under the Word which they hear; this was <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Sin, which greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their Corruption, even the ſame Means which was ſent to ſoften them, turned to their hardning, through their unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs under it, <hi>Iſa. 5. 1, 2. My Beloved had a Vineyard in a very fruitful Hill, and he looked for Grapes, and it brought forth wild Grapes:</hi> But what was the Iſſue of this? Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Go

               <p>1ſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> This ſerves then, in the firſt place, to inform us of the Duty both of the Miniſters and Hearers.</p>

He was to go to the Prieſt, and tell the Prieſt, that it ſeemed to him, that there is as it were a Plague in the Houſe; ſo in like manner ought every Paſtor or Miniſter to do, even by Prayer, Faſting and true Humiliation, to acquaint Jeſus Chriſt the great High-Prieſt, with the leprous Diſtemper, which is broken forth in his Churches: This is the Advice which the Spirit of God gave the Old Teſtament-churches, as a means to cure them of their Pollution and Defilement, <hi>Joel 2. 16, 17, 18.

               </p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the ſecond Obſervation:</p>
               <p>2d Doct. <hi>That the Defilements and Pollutions, which the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Christ are ſubject unto, while in this Life, are many times very open and viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this Note, I ſhall, <hi>firſt,</hi> prove it. <hi>2dly,</hi> Give you the Reaſons of it. And, <hi>3ily,</hi> apply it.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>First,</hi> for the Proof of it, if you look back to the Old Teſtament-church, how open and viſible were the Pollutions and Deſilements of it, <hi>Ezek. 24. 7. For her Bloud is in the midst of her, ſhe ſet it upon the top of a Rock, ſhe poured it out upon the Ground to cover it with the Dust.</hi> Hoſ. 4. 13. <hi>They Sacrifice upon the tops of the Mountains, and burn Incenſe upon the Hills.</hi> Zeph. 1. 5. <hi>And them that Worſhip the Host of Heaven upon the Houſe tops.</hi> Now what could be more open and viſible, than to commit their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34102:38"/> upon high Hills, high Mountains, and Houſe-tops? So the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was once ſtiled the Beloved of God, and called to be Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. yet at laſt how open and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick was the Pollution of that Church, <hi>Rev. 17. 5. And upon her Forehead was written, Myſtery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abomination of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Reaſons of the Point:</p>

                  <hi>Reaſons.]</hi> The firſt is drawn from Satan. The ſecond from God; and, The third from the Churches themſelves.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon is drawn from the Devil, who out of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Enmity to God, and Hatred to his Honour and Glory, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to drive on the Corruption, by the corrupt Inclinations of the People of God, to the higheſt pitch what he can: He knows that the Honour of God never ſuffers ſo much by the Sin of a profane World, as it doth by the Sin of one of God's Churches in the World; and this is that which makes God ſo ſevere with his People, in puniſhing of them when they offend him with their Tranſgreſſions, <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Devil doth it in Policy, that he might thereby ſo much the more ſtabliſh the Hearts of his own Children in their Wickedneſs; beſides he knoweth that it will abundantly ſtumble weak Chriſtians in their way to <hi>Sion,</hi> hoping thereby to bring them back again into their old Snare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from God himſelf, who in a way of Judgment to a People, that ſhall take a liberty to Sin in any one degree, and refuſing to be reclaimed, then God gives them up to a greater freedom to Sin, <hi>Hoſ. 8. 11.

               <p>The third Reaſon is drawn from the Churches themſelves, with reſpect to the unmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Peter,</hi> What could be more viſible and open, than to Curſe and Swear that he knew not his Maſter? So good <hi>Aaron,</hi> How open was his Sin in making the golden Calf?</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Application:</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:34102:39"/>
               <p>1ſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Is this ſo, that many times the Defilement and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches of Chriſt are ſo open and viſible, while in this Life? Let it ſerve then to ſtir up the Churches and People of God, to labour after a ſpotleſs holy Converſation, that they may regain the Honour which God hath ſo often loſt, through the careleſs walking of the reſt of God's profeſſing People: You hear how induſtrious the Devil is to endeavour the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſpiritual Houſes of Chriſt, whileſt they are in this World, which ariſeth from his Malice and Hatred to his Creator, and that he may harden his Children in their Sins, and damp the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of weak Chriſtians in Godlineſs: Oh! how ſhould this ſtir up the Hearts and Hands of all (that have any Love to Chriſt) to be preſſing on ſo much the more in the Practice of true Godlineſs, redeeming the Time becauſe the Days are evil, that the World may ſee that Chriſt hath (yet) a few Names in <hi>Sardis,</hi> that do walk with him in white, and have not defiled their Garments as the moſt have done! Have other Churches their Spots upon them? How ſhould you get your Garments waſhed in the Bloud of the Lamb? Are other Churches publickly Scandalous, Earthly-minded, walking with a proud and haughty Spirit? Oh! how ſhould you labour to regain the loſt Honour of Chriſt again, in labouring after a more heavenly frame of Spirit, in being meek, holy, and humble in the ſight of all Men? Oh! that you would conſider this, that Jeſus Chriſt was never more wounded in the Houſe of his Friends, than at this Day: Oh! if you have any Love for Chriſt, labour to heal theſe Wounds again, by adorning the Doctrine of God and your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with your holy Converſations: Oh! forget not what a large Portion he hath given you in his Bloud, and what a good Inheritance he hath purchaſed for you by his Bloud; let him have the Fruit of it which is a holy Converſation, <hi>John</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2d <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Have the Houſes of Chriſt been hitherto ſubject to their Defilements and Pollutions; Learn hence then by Faith and Prayer to haſten on thoſe happy Times, which the Word of Propheſie faith, are yet to come upon the Churches of Chriſt in this Life, when theſe ſpiritual Habitations of his, ſhall no more be troubled with theſe leprous Defilements and Pollutions in this World. There is one Propheſie which I ſhall mention for all the reſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 13. with 16 Ver. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favour her, yea the ſet-time is come: When the Lord ſhall build up Zion, he will appear in his Glory.</hi> I grant that this Propheſie (partly) had its fulfilling in the <hi>Jews</hi> Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of their ſeventy Years Captivity by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34102:39"/> building of the ſecond Temple by <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> but this was not the utmoſt extent of the Propheſie, which clearly points to the latter times of the Goſpel-churches; even when as in <hi>Ver.</hi> 22 of this <hi>Pſal. The People are gathered together, and the Kingdoms to ſerve the Lord.</hi> Which time <hi>John</hi> the Divine, placeth after the great Rent that ſhall be made in <hi>Antichrist</hi>'s Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. and then he tells you in <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. that the Kingdoms of this World, are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall Reign for ever and ever; ſo that then, and not till then, may we expect the full Accompliſhment of this Propheſie, in this 102 <hi>Pſal.</hi> Ver. 13, with 16. Certainly, this muſt needs be a glorious Work, and a very glorious Day, when the Lord ſhall ariſe to build <hi>Zion</hi> himſelf, but although it be ſaid, that God will build <hi>Zion</hi> himſelf, we are not to underſtand it in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the uſe of outward Means or humane Inſtruments which God hath formerly uſed in this Work; no, but comparatively, ſuch will the marvelous Preſence of his Glory be, which he will then attend thoſe withal, which he will employ in this Work of building his <hi>Zion,</hi> as if God had never had a Hand in the Work before; which will make the Work exceeding excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in four Reſpects; beyond whatever the Churches were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For Beauty and Glory, in the Eyes of the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 11, 12. <hi>Oh thou afflicted, and toſſed with tempest, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, behold, I will lay thy Stones with fair Colours, and lay thy Foundations with Saphires.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Work will be as marvelous for Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Churches, who have enjoyed very little of this in the Ages of the World heretofore; indeed, for a ſpurt or a ſhort ſpace of time, we have found that the Churches of Chriſt have had ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When the Lord ſhall ariſe to build <hi>Zion</hi> the Work will be firmly and laſtingly done; tho' the former Builders were gracious and godly Men, yet how quickly have their Work tumbled down again? <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> which builded the Temple and City of <hi>Zion</hi> at firſt, and though they were holy and wiſe Men, yet their Building ſtood not long after them: And the like we read of, <hi>Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Men of great Wiſdom and Integrity, who were Builders of the City and Temple of <hi>Zion</hi> a ſecond time; but, alas! how ſoon did the <hi>Romans</hi> demoliſh their Work again? But when God ſhall ariſe to build <hi>Zion</hi> himſelf, the Work ſhall ſurely ſtand for ever, as that no <hi>Sanballet</hi> or <hi>Tobiah</hi> ſhall be able to obſtruct it, nor no <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> or <hi>Roman Titus</hi> ſhall ever be able to pull down this Work to the World's end. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>And the Lord will create up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon her Aſſemblies, a Cloud and a Smoak by Day, and the Shining of a flaming Fire by Night, for upon all the Glory ſhall be a Defence.</hi> Oh, that we could get ſuch a ſight of this glorious Work by Faith, as might put us upon the haſtning of it into the World by Prayer!</p>

                     </gap>lgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven; Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> I know, that ſome are of the Opinion, that this 17 Verſe is to be applied to the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> he only was to let <hi>Ephraim</hi> alone, ſo as not to Preach or Propheſie to them any more, ſeeing they would ſtill be a rebellious Houſe; but who ever ſhall compare Chap. 1. Ver. 9, with the 4 Chap. and the 15, 16, 17 Ver. muſt needs conclude, that it was <hi>Judah</hi>'s Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the ten Idolatrous Tribes, which was principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in theſe Texts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The like Truth will the New Teſtament afford us; for if we conſider the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in its original and firſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34102:41"/> Plantation, none can deny but that it was a famous Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church of Jeſus Chriſt, and one of the Golden-candleſticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which he delighted to walk; for we read that their Faith was ſpoken of throughout the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. but withal, you may read, when they became a leprous Church, and would not be healed, are then all the ſound People of God required to ſeparate from her, <hi>Rev. 18. 4. And I heard another Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, Come out of her my People, that ye be not Partakers of her Sins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what kind of Corruption is it, which will warrant our Separation from any Church in order to our Preſervation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That moſt of our Divines do agree in this, that a Churches Corruption in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; this gives Warrant for our Separation from ſuch a Church. And, that a Separation from ſuch a Church appears to be our Duty, will appear from theſe Grounds:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe of the Reaſon which is given in the Caſe of the Levitical Houſe, <hi>Lev. 14. 36. Ye ſhall empty the Houſe, that all that is in the Houſe be not made Vnclean.</hi> But ſpiritual Pollution is the moſt dangerous of all, it ſeizeth the ſpiritual part, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more to be abandoned; Nature teacheth Men to avoid the Plague, which only endangereth the Body; and ought we not much more avoid that Plague which doth inevitably endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger our Souls to our eternal Dammage? A corporal Leproſie doth only ſhut out the Diſeaſed from Communion with Men, but a ſpiritual Leproſie, ſhuts Men out from Communion with God, <hi>Iſa. 59. 2. But your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your Sins have hid his Face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> God can Love us, Comfort us, and hold Communion with us, under the greateſt outward Pollution that can light upon our outward Man; but he can neither Love us, or Delight in us, not hold the leaſt Fellowſhip with us, in our allowed Sins.</p>
               <p>2d <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> Why we ought to ſeparate from corrupt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if unreclaimable, becauſe, otherwiſe, we make our ſelves Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with them in their evil Deeds, for we ought not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with other Mens Sins, <hi>Rev. 18. 4. Partake not with her in her Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3d <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> Becauſe if we partake with others in their Sins, we are liable to partake with them in the Puniſhment which God ſhall inflict upon them for the ſame, <hi>Rev. 18. 4. Partake not with her in her Sins, lest ye partake of her Plagues.</hi> God hath Plagues for Apoſtatizing Churches, and Puniſhments for thoſe that ſhall ioyn with them: Good <hi>Jehoſhaphat's</hi> joyning with an Idolatrous <hi>Ahab,</hi> was like to coſt him his Life; God will puniſh

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſed, if they be both found in one Tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>4th <hi>Reaſon.]</hi> Why we muſt ſeparate from unreclaimable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Churches, is, becauſe in ſo doing we are Witneſſes for God againſt their evil Deeds: You may read, that when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> became a corrupt Church, firſt, God gave his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed People a Call to ſeparate from her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. And, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Stirs up his People to be Witneſſes againſt her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Application: <hi>Vſe,</hi> From all that hath been ſaid upon this Point, let us learn theſe four Leſſons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st,</hi> Let us learn to be Humble. <hi>2dly,</hi> Fruitful. <hi>3dly,</hi> Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And, <hi>4thly,</hi> Watchful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let us learn to be Low and Humble in our own Eyes, many of us may have Parts, Gifts and Graces, enough to make us to forget our ſelves, if the Lord, by a ſtrong Hand upon our Hearts, did not keep us Humble. Oh! remember that all your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements are of Free-grace, you have nothing which you can call your own but your Sins, therefore have you nothing of your own to be proud of, or to glory in, unleſs you will glory in your Shame; your Sins are yours, and your Corruptions are yours, and your inward Thoughts are full of Rottenneſs, and can you boaſt of this? And what you have beſides this, is none of yours but God's; And will you be proud of that which Free-grace hath beſtowed upon you? Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, Who is it which makes thee to differ? And what haſt thou which thou haſt not received? You yet retain the Eſſentials of a Church, whileſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have loſt theirs, and you yet ſtand when ſome other Churches are dropt to the Ground, you yet retain the Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and good Diſcipline accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Order of the Goſpel is upheld amongſt you, when both Doctrine and good Diſcipline are almoſt worn to nothing in ſome other Churches: Oh! be not High-minded, but fear: Oh! remember that you are as liable to fall from your Stedfaſtneſs as any Church which hath fallen before you; and you are liable to the worſt of Errors and Corruption both in Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline as well as others, and you ſtand by Faith, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: Oh! take heed, becauſe you are never nearer Ruine, than when your Gifts, Parts and Priviledges do lift you up, <hi>Luke 10. 15. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted to Heaven, ſhall be thrust down into Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let it teach us Fruitfulneſs, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which will preſerve your ſtanding more than this; not to receive the Truth in the Love of it, is the ready way to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34102:42"/> loſe it, and to be given up to believe Lies, that you may be Damned, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and not to hear the Word mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Faith, is the ready way to loſe the Faith at laſt; it's the Barrenneſs of the Vineyard which makes the Huſbandman to throw it open to the wild Beaſts, which was the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God to his <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Ver. therefore look to it, that your Hearts and Lives be fruitful; God will not be put off with the fruitleſs Leaves of an empty outward Profeſſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 19. When once we let go the Power and Life of Religion, and think to pleaſe God with an empty Form of Godlineſs, he will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew ſuch Churches, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church-members out of his Mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. Oh! let us labour for a ſpirit of Zeal and Fervency in all we do for God; let the Heart-ſearching God, ſee more of our Sincerity, Faith, and Love to him, in all the Duties of our Obedience which we direct to him, with more of our Self-denia, Meekneſs, Mercy, Charity and Holineſs in our Converſations before him: Oh! ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count not your ſelves truly ſafe, longer than you are anſwering the ends of your ſpiritual Priviledges; you have had much from God, many choice Ordinances, many a precious Waterings, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich Gifts and Graces. all which do call ſor great Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Oh! have a care, that for theſe golden Doilars, you pay him not off with a ſew braſs Counters again at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> Let it learn you the Duty of Thankfulneſs to God, that you are yet a People, bearing his Name upon you, and that you are yet Churches and Houſes ſtanding in the Faith of our Lord Jeſus; and eſpecially, let us bleſs God for this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that he hath made ſuch proviſion for our Preſervation, to keep us from that Corruption which hath ſo much endangered other Churches, which Proviſion lieth in that Precept of his, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 18. requiring our Separation from other infected Churches that will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>aled. What a ſad condition had the reformed Churches been in, who lived in the Bowels of the <hi>Roman</hi> Apoſtacy, if they might not have had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſeparate from them? But, you hear, it was not only their Liberty, but their commanded Duty ſo to do. You have alſo ſeen in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>evitical Houſe, which was a Tipe of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Houſes of Jeſus Chriſt, the Prieit was to command, that the things in the Houſe not infected, ſhould be all brought forth, that they might be preſerved from the Leproſie within; which was a merciful Proviſion to be embraced with Thankſgiving: Oh! therefore, be you truly thankful to God, Firſt, In that you may ſeparate your ſelves from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>prous Churches for your own Preſervation. Secondly, Be thankful that it is not your Portion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34102:42"/> to be ſeparated from by others for your own Pollution, that the red Croſs is not yet fixed upon your Church-doors, to be a Warning to all others to ſtand off from you: Oh! how doth this call upon all ſuch Churches for Thankfulneſs to God for his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preſerving of you, and to cry out with <hi>David,</hi> Let us take the Cup of Salvation, and give Thanks to thy Name; and ſee to it, that it be not a Lip-thankfulneſs only, but a Life-thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs principally: Let your Obedience to God, be the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Goodneſs to your Souls, becauſe he delighteth more in Obedience, than in whole Burnt-offerings, or Sacrifices of the fatteſt Lambs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let this Truth teach us Watchfulneſs; wakeful Chriſtians are uſually the ſafeſt Chriſtians, ſafeſt from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Pollutions which ſecure Chriſtians and Churches are endangered by. The Watchman's ſleepy Seaſon, was the Evil Ones ſeeding Seaſon, <hi>Matr.</hi> 13. 25. the Devil (by whoſe hand the Churches of Chriſt are defiled) is a wakeful Enemy, who doth but watch when Chriſtians are ſecure, then is his time to work and plot their Ruine. St. <hi>Peter</hi> well underſtood this, therefore gave the Churches this Admonition, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 8. Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your Adverſary, the Devil, like a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion, goeth about ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> You know in peſtilential Seaſons, when the Plague is hot in a Town or City, then will Men keep Watch and Ward in thoſe Towns and Cities which are free from the Diſeaſe, that they may preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe, otherwiſe, a great deal of Hurt may acrue to ſuch Places in a little ſpace of time: No leſs Security ought the Churches of Chriſt to take to preſerve themſelves, becauſe they live in a World of Danger; the Plague is every-where round about them, in every Heart, in every Houſe, that they have to do with all; the Plague of Hypocriſie, Formality, Pride, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, Errour, Idolatry, with all manner of lying Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with ſtrong Deluſions of deceivable Unrighteouſneſs, in every Place you can light upon, or enter into; all which calls upon all Chriſtians and Chriſtian churches, to be watchful, and narrowly to look to themſelves.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the ſecond Ground of Diſcovery, namely, Why the Inhabitant of the leprous Houſe, was to go to the Prieſt, and to ſay, That it ſeemeth to me, there is as it were a Plague in the Houſe; the Purpoſe of it was, that the Houſe might be healed, <hi>Lev. 14. 41. And he ſhall cauſe the Houſe to be ſcraped within, round about, and they ſhall pour out the Dust, that they ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, without the City, into an unclean place.</hi> Which leads us to the ſecond General, namely, To the Remedy it ſelf, about which we may obſerve theſe things:</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:34102:43"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Healer, or the Perſon healing, and that was the Prieſt, <hi>Ver.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are next to obſerve, what was to be done by the Prieſt, in order to the Healing of the leprous Houſe; where, firſt, he was to ſcrape off that part of the Wall which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If that would not do, then was he to take out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Stones, and to place other Stones in the room of the former, Ver. 40, 41, 42. Which leads us to the laſt thing, <hi>(viz.)</hi> If nothing of all this Means uſed, will prove healing to the Houſe, then was the Prieſt to break down the Houſe, the Stones thereof, the Timber thereof, and the Mortar thereof, and carry it out of the City, into an unclean place, <hi>Ver.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>But, firſt of all, we are to take notice of the Perſon who was the Healer, and that was the Prieſt, <hi>Ver. 36. 37. The Priest ſhall go into the Houſe, and ſhall look on the Plague:</hi> Which Prieſt in this Work was a Tipe of Chriſt, who is our great Goſpel High-Prieſt, whoſe Office it is to heal his Goſpel-houſes of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Leproſies, which they are ſubject unto whilſt in this World.</p>
               <p>From whence we may obſerve this Note:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That Jeſus Christ is the great Healer of all the ſpiritual Leproſies, Pollutions and Defilements, which happens to his Churches in this Life.</hi> Jer. 3. 22. <hi>Return ye back-ſliding Children, and I will heal your Back-ſlidings.</hi> Exod. 15. 26. <hi>I am the Lord that healeth thee.</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 22. <hi>The Lord hearkned to Hezekiah, and healed the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He healeth his Churches of the Guilt of Sin, by the ſprinkling of his Bloud upon them, 1 <hi>John 1. 7. The Bloud of Jeſus Christ cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He healeth them of the Prevalency of Sin, <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Thirdly,</hi> He healeth them of the Fruits and Effects of Sin; as, firſt, he healeth his Churches of their erronious Doctrine, <hi>Prov. 8. 20. Iſa.</hi> 42. 16, with Chap. 29. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He healeth his Churches of their Lukewarmneſs, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He healeth them of their Barrenneſs and Unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under the Means of Grace, which conſiſts of his Word of Inſtruction and Rod of Correction, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4, 5, 6 Ver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Chriſt healeth his Churches of their Diviſions, and that unhappy contentious Spirit, which the Devil is always kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling amongſt them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Are the Churches of Chriſt, (ſometimes) torn and rent to pieces with Errour and violent Perſecution? Chriſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34102:43"/> will have his time, when to heal his Churches of all theſe Rents and Wounds, which they have ſuffered for his Name and Glory in this World, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 16. In a word, he hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Healing in himſelf for his Churches (who is their Tree of Life for that purpoſe) but the Leaves which hang about him, brings Health and Healing to the Nations of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where-ever he goeth, he carrieth Healing in his Wings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 42. 2.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Application.</p>
               <p>1ſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Is this ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt is the great Healer of the ſpiritual Leproſies of his Churches? this ſerves to inform them, then, where to go, and unto whom to repair, for ſpiritual Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when their ſpiritual Leproſies do at any time break out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. You have ſeen that it was the Levitical Prieſt, which was appointed to heal the leprous Houſe under the Old Teſtament, ſo it is Jeſus Chriſt our Goſpel-Prieſt, and only him, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to heal the ſpiritual Houſes of the Lord under the New Teſtament; and as God the Father appointed him to this Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work, ſo did he fit him with all unſpeakable Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it, <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good Tydings to the Meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken Hearted, and to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and to open the Priſon-doors to them that are bound.</hi> And, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> The Fulneſs of Grace is in him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. not only a fulneſs of Grace, but a fulneſs of Grace and Truth too, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. Certainly we do but run from the Living to the Dead, when we go for a Cure of Church-pollution, to any means (pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily) but Chriſt in this caſe: Yet, how common is it to hear ſome Chriſtians, relieving their dying Hopes under Church-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays and Diſorders, in looking to ſome outward Means for help at this ſide Chriſt? Oh, their great Hopes have been, that the King, or ſuch and ſuch a Parliament, Synod, or Convocation would ſet things in better order, and give us a Cure to all our Church-deviſions and Diſtempers: But, alas! Princes, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Synods and Counſels, may pity, but little profit the Churches under their ſpiritual Maladies; but to cure them, they cannot, becauſe the <hi>Gilead</hi>-balm which ſhould do the Work, they have not with them: <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, laboured as much to heal the Churches of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, as ever did any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but he found it a Task for no earthly King to perform: Oh! no, it was only Chriſt that was appointed and fitted for this Work, it is Chriſt and not Man, that hath the Honour to be the Repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>Zion</hi>'s Breaches, and of raiſing up the decayed Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>David,</hi> it's none but he that can cloſe up the Breaches of his

Thus having viewed the Healer of the leprous Houſe, which was the Prieſt; we next come to conſider, what was to be done by the Prieſt, in order to the Healing of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He was to ſcrape off that part of the Wall in the Houſe, which was infected with the Leproſie, <hi>Ver. 41. He ſhall cauſe the Houſe to be ſcraped within round about.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Action of the Levitical Prieſt, doth livelily Type out the Work of Chriſt, who is our Goſpel High-Prieſt, in the cleanſing of his Goſpel Spiritual-houſes; we need not doubt, but the levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Prieſt had his Inſtruments and other Means, to uſe in the cleanſing of the leprous Houſe. So Jeſus Chriſt he hath alſo his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Means to uſe in the cleanſing of his leprous Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; no doubt but the Levitical Prieſt had his <hi>Levites</hi> to aſſiſt him in ſcraping off the infected Plaiſter of the Houſe; ſo hath Jeſus Chriſt, his Miniſters to work by, in the ſcraping off the Pollution of his Churches: Hence they are called Work-men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. and Labourers, ſuch as labour in the Word and Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Means which Chriſt uſeth in cleanſing of his Churches, is the Preaching of the Word, with the Power of the Holy Ghoſt working with it, <hi>John 15. 3. Now are ye clean through the Word, which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> By this it is, that Chriſt ſcrapes his Churches clean, from that leprous Filth which is apt to cleave unto them; by this it was, which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He ſent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their Deſtruction.</hi> By this it was which he healed by ſcraping his People in <hi>Babylon,</hi> from that Uncleanneſs, which they went away Foul and Filthy withal from their own Land: He ſent his Word and Prophets to them, to ſcrape them clean of that Defilement, <hi>Ezek. 3. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus ſaith the Lord, In the Day that I ſhall have cleanſed you, from all your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I will cauſe you to dwell in the Cities.</hi> And by the ſame Means it was, which our Lord endeavoured to cleanſe the ſeven Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as <hi>Epheſus,</hi> from their coldneſs of Love to him, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34102:45"/> he ſent his Word to them all by his Servant <hi>John,</hi> to cleanſe them from their ſpiritual Leproſies and Pollution, <hi>Rev. 1. 4, 5 Verſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But if the uſe of this means will not do, Chriſt will uſe other means that ſhall, and that is Affliction: If the Word will not ſcrape, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>od ſhall rake, until Chriſt hath fetch'd off the Ruſt from his People; the Rod, ſometimes, eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cts and brings to paſs what the Word doth not; the Word may, and doth ſhew Men their Duty, but it's the Rod which drives Men to it; many a Man, which hath leapt over the Word, yet at laſt hath been fetcht back again by the Rod: Afflictions (if ſanctifyed) are as neceſſary for the People of God, as Phyſick is for a diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Body, they are purging Means in order to a healthful Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. <hi>David</hi> found much good by his Afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. Afflictions makes way for the entrance of the Word into the Affections, which have lain for ſome Years as lifeleſs upon the Heart, as Seed upon the Ground that wants Rain. <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Brethren, who ſinfully ſold him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> lay under the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented Gilt of that Sin for twenty Years together, until the Rod of Affliction awakened it in their Conſciences, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21.</p>
               <p>So we come to the Application.</p>
               <p>1ſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> This then ſhould teach the Churches of God great Thankfulneſs to him, who hath made ſuch gracious Proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſpiritual Maladies, he might have ſuffered you all to have periſhed in your Pollutions and Defilements, and have took as great Satisfaction in the glorifying of his Juſtice in your final De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as in magnifying of the Riches of his Grace and Mercy in your Recovery: Oh! but on the other Hand, what cauſe have we all to adore the Riches of boundleſs Grace with a thankful Admiration, that a Fountain of Mercy is ſound out, and ſet wide open for the worſt of Lepers, and leprous Churches, to Waſh in and be Clean? Are you liable to the Leproſie of Pride, Paſſion, Lukewarmneſs, Errours. Earthly-mindedneſs? Doth a Spirit of Diſcord, Backbiting and Envy break forth amongſt you? Lo here is the Word and Ordinances of the Goſpel in Place, to ſcrape and cleanſe off all this from you, which if attended with a divine Bleſſing, it is a quick and powerful Means, ſharper than a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sword, to divide aſunder the Joynts and Marrow, the Soul and Spirit, and is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts of the Heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. And you have heard, if this Means will not do, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God will ſuffer his People to Periſh and Rot in their Corruption, he will uſe his Rod of Correction, to ſet home his Word of Inſtruction upon their Souls, which ſhall ſmart their Backs, to recover their Hearts, <hi>Iſa. 27. 9. By this therefore the</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:34102:45"/> 
                  <hi>Iniquity of Jacob ſhall he purged, this ſhall be the Fruit thereof, I will take away their Sin.</hi> Oh! therefore all ye that are the Seeds of <hi>Jacob,</hi> be you thankful to God that he hath given you his Word, and will not ſuffer you to want his Rod, they being both appointed in his divine Wiſdom, as a healing Means againſt your ſpiritual Leproſies, whenever they ſhall break out upon you: How ſhould the thoughts of this abundant Care of God over you, make you to cry out with <hi>David, Pſal. 103. 2, 3. O bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all within me forget not his holy Benefits, who forgiveth all thy Iniquities, and healeth all thy Diſeaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2d <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Let this Truth ſerve to perſwade, all the cleanſed Lepers of Chriſt, to carry the Matter as they ought to do, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the means of their Cleanſing, which, as you have heard, conſiſts of theſe two things: <hi>First,</hi> The Word of Inſtruction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the Rod of Correction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First of all,</hi> See to it, that you carry the Matter well towards the Word of Inſtruction, ſo as not to impriſon it in your Heads; make not your Heads (as too many do) a Jayl to the Word: there be but too many that will hold the Truth in Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who are unwilling that the Light of the Word, which is got into their Heads, ſhould come down into their Hearts, for fear leſt its ſhining Light ſhould become a perplexing Heat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them; to prevent that, they ſtrive to hold faſt the Doors againſt the Truth, as a Man who fears an Arreſt, bolts faſt the Doors of his Houſe againſt the Bailiffs; but if ever you mean co have benefit by the Word, ſo as to be cleanſed from your ſinful Leproſies, you muſt let the Truth out of Priſon, and give it a free Paſſage, that it may be glorified in you: Let it run from Room to Room, from the Head to the Heart, and from the Heart to the Will, and from the Will to the Conſcience, and from thence to the Affections, that ſo it might have an uninterrupted Out-let into the Converſation; ſo to do, is co carry the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you ought towards the Word of Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be ſure you carry the Matter well towards the Rod of God's Correction; when Afflictions do light upon you, do not fret, repine, nor murmur at them, as if ſome ſore Evil had hapned to you for your Hurt; but rather rejoyce under them, that God by them is about to ſcrape and cleanſe you from that Heart-naughtineſs which cleaveth to you; and if the Rod ſeems to ſmart, do not ſay to God as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, <hi>Jonah 4. 9. I do well to be angry to Death:</hi> But rather to ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 75. <hi>In faithfulneſs hast thou afflicted me.</hi> And inſtead of muttering at the length or ſtrength of your Affliction, you ſhould reaſon thus: It ſeems that our Luſts are ſtrong, and our Corruptions are root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34102:46"/> faſt in us, which makes our dear Redeemer to put the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrength into our Afflictions; for, where the Diſeaſe in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is more malignant than ordinary, there the Ingredients muſt be the ſtronger in the Medicine to work it forth again: Chriſt had rather his People ſhould be preſerved in Brine, than rot in Honey; and you may be ſure of this, that when Chriſt by his Rod hath done his Work upon you, then may you expect the removal of it from you, <hi>Iſa. 4. 4, 5. When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the Filth of the Daughter of Zion, then will be create upon the Dwelling-places thereof, a Cloud and a Smoke by Day, and the ſhining of a flaming Fire by Night, and a Glory, with a Defence upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have ſeen what the Prieſt was to do, in order to the Cleanſing of the Levitical leprous Houſe, and how well it ſhadowed out the Way, Inſtruments, and Means, which our great Goſpel High Prieſt uſeth, in Cleanſing of his Churches from their ſpiritual Leproſies and Defilements: We now come to a ſecond Work which the Prieſt was to do, in order to the preſerving of the Levitical Houſe that was infected; his Work was to pull out the infected Stones thereof, and to put other Stones in the room of them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 40, with 42 Ver. <hi>Then the Priest ſhall command that they take away the Stones, in which the Plague is, and be ſhall take other Stones, and put them in the place of thoſe Stones, and he ſhall take other Mortar and plaiſter the Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, if ſcraping of the Walls, wherein the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lay, would not ſerve the turn, then the infected Stones muſt be pulled out, and caſt away into an unclean Place; which Action, in a moſt lively manner, leads us to behold the ſacred Order which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt obſerves, in the Cleanſing and keeping Clean of his Goſpel-churches; who, in like manner, if the Means he hath already uſed will not do, (as his ſcraping of them by his Word of Inſtruction, and the ſmarting of them with his Rod of Correction,) if nothing of this Means will heal, then out muſt the Stones be pluckt in which the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But ſome may ask, What, or who may we underſtand by the Stones of Chriſt's ſpiritual Houſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are the viſible Members of Chriſt's Churches, 1 <hi>Yet. 2. 5. Ye alſo as lively Stones, are built up a ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Priest-hood, to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Christ.</hi> So that the Meaning will amount to this, That if any of theſe Stones ſhall be ſo leprous, as that neither the Word nor Rod will procure their Amendment, wherein they walk contrary to ſound Doctrine, either in Judgment or Practice,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34102:46"/> then ought they to be ſeparated from the reſt of their Brethren, by a Church-excommunication. You ſee how clear this appears in the Tipe, the infected Stones were to be pulled out of the Houſe, to ſhew us that the incurable infected Members of Chriſt's Houſe (which <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Stones thereof) muſt be pulled out from thence alſo.</p>
               <p>From whence we may obſerve this Note:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That when ordinary Means have been uſed to reclaim offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church-members, but all to no purpoſe, then is the Church to cast out ſuch corrupt Members, by an Act of Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſuch a neceſſary Rule to the keeping of the Churches clean, that it is an eſtabliſhed Rule by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Matt. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs against thee, go to him and tell him his Fault, between thee and him alone; and if he ſhall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes, every Word may be eſtabliſhed; and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church, but if he ſhall neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen Man and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi> The meaning is, let him be caſt out of the Church, no more to be communed, with than a profeſt Pagan, or the worſt of Men, unleſs he Repents; which act of Excommunication, paſt upon incurable Offenders, you may read at large in the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>-Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4, 5 Verſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as an Addition to this ſevere <hi>Corinthian.</hi> Excommunication, which was executed upon the Inceſtuous Perſon, you may read what a ſtrict Charge the Apoſtle gives to the Members of this Church, that if a Brother be known amongſt them, to be a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, or Covetous, or a Railer, or an Idolater, or a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an Extortioner, not to keep Company with ſuch a Man. Thus you ſee the Point proved by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the Reaſon of it:</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon is drawn from the Will of God, God will have it to be ſo: So that a Neglect in the doing of this Work by the Churches, it will be groſly inexcuſable on their Part: The Will of God in this Matter, hath been ſufficiently revealed to you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, both in the Tipe of the Levitical Houſe under the Old Teſtament, and by our Saviour's Words under the New, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. with 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4, 5 Verſes.</hi> And it will be eſteemed as our Righteouſneſs, (I mean a Righteouſneſs of Sincerity) if we fulfil the Will of God, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>Second Reaſon why the Churches of Chriſt ſhould caſt out incurable leprous Perſons from amongſt them, is, Becauſe, as by their Sin they have forſaken their God, they thereby have given
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34102:47"/> God cauſe to forſake them; therefore ought the Churches to forſake the Company of ſuch too: The ground of the Churches Union one with another, is that viſible Union which they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſedly hold to Jeſus Chriſt, but when in outward Appearance, the Bond of that ſacred Relation (which any proſeſs they hold to Chriſt) ceaſeth, then is their viſible Union to Chriſt diſſolved by it: Becauſe it was founded and built upon viſible Holineſs, and when viſible Holineſs ceaſeth, the Union ceaſeth alſo: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoever they are that oppoſe the Father and Son, as to their Laws and Government, ought to be oppoſed by all the Lord's People, <hi>Pſal. 139. 21, 22. Do not I hate them that hate thee? am not I grieved at them that riſe up againſt thee? Yea, I hate them with a perfect Hatred, I count them my Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Third Reaſon: It's ſo becauſe God hath promiſed his peculiar Preſence amongſt his Churches, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18, 20. But he will not be in any ſuch Sence with any Church, but upon Terms of their Purity, and that they keep themſelves clean Houſes to him and for his Company, <hi>Pſal. 93. 5. Holineſs becometh thine Houſe, O Lord.</hi> Men that return (after a religious Profeſſion made) to their old ſinful Courſe again, are compared to the Sow that was once Waſhed, to Wallow in their old Mire again, and as a Dog that licks in his old Vomit: And be ſure of this, that God will not make his abode with dirty Swine and filthy Dogs: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Churches do not proceed to the Caſting out of ſuch Swine and Dogs from amongſt them, they may expect that God will not continue long amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Fourth Reaſon, why Churches ought to Caſt out their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable infected Members, is, Becauſe otherwiſe, they may be infected, with the ſame Infection themſelves; according to the old Proverb, One ſcabbed Sheep may ſpoil a whole Flock: And doth not the Apoſtle ſay as much, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 6. Know ye not that a little Leaven, leaveneth the whole Lump?</hi> Pſal. 106. 35. <hi>They were mingled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nong the Heathen, and learnt their Works.</hi> As one rotten Apple may corrupt a whole Heap, ſo may one rotten Member corrupt a whole Church, nothing more da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gerous than to be Familiar with Men of corrupt Lives and corrupt Principles; for their Words will Eat as doth a Canker, (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> of whom is <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus, 2 Tim. 2. 17.</hi> If <hi>Corab</hi> be of a terbulent Spirit himſelf, and over-run with Pride and Envy, he quickly draweth no leſs than two hundred and fifty Princes of the Congregation into his Conſpiracy, to their utter Ruine, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 1, 2. with the 35 <hi>Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly and Laſtly, The Reaſon why the Churches are to caſt out their polluted Members, is, That thoſe of them who belong to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34102:47"/> the Election of Grace, may thereby be recovered again, and made the fitter for the Bulding at laſt: It is a common Saying, That a Bone once broken, if well ſet again, is ſtronger in that part than ever it was before: This is that merciful End which God aims at towards ſome, (who are habitually living Stones) in and by their Excommunication. To this Purpoſe it will not be amiſs to read the Inſtitution, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4, 5. In the Name of our Jeſus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my Spirit with the Power of our Lord Jeſus Christ, to deliver ſuch a one unto Satan, for the Deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Mark the word, That the Spirit might be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus; that is, at the great and laſt Day, when he ſhall come in flaming Fire to Judge both Quick and Dead. So that you ſee, that God cuts off ſome of his here in this Life, that they may not be out off from the Life which is to come; he will caſt ſome out of the Church milirant, that they may not be caſt off from the Church triumphant: God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the Soul (by this Ordinance) into the hands of Satan for a time, that thereby he might deliver him from the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan for ever; though the Means applied be ſharp, yet it being bleſt of God to that end, the Effect you ſee will be good, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and profitable: Oh the depths both of the Riches of the Grace, Wiſdom, and Counſel of God, which appears in this thing! How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways poſt finding out!</p>
               <p>Thus having given you the Reaſons of the Point, we next come to Apply it:</p>
               <p>

Oh! how lamentable is it, that ſome Churches that were the perfection of Beauty, and the joy of our Land, are now, in many places, ſo polluted and defiled, that they are become the Objects of Grief and Sorrow to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſound-hearted Chriſtians; and that which adds to their Grief is, that there is not one <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to be found in a Country, that zealouſly concerns himſelf about theſe things, either to remedy it, or labour to be helpful in it; but inſtead thereof, the moſt of Men fall upon the Work of building up the Honour, Dignity, and Wealth of their own Houſes. Is this Mens Love to Jeſus Chriſt? Is this their Faithfulneſs to their Lord and Maſter? And had they the Houſes of God committed to their Care for no other end and purpoſe, but to let them lye in their leprous Uncleanneſs, whileſt themſelves are building their own ceiled Houſes, at the coſtlieſt and cleaneſt Rate they can invent and imagine? Will this Work endure the fiery Trial at the great Day of Account?</p>
               <p>2d <hi>Vſe,</hi> Is for caution to thoſe, who yet have not ioyned themſelves to any particular Church: Beware then amongſt whom you liſt your ſelves for Church-communion, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where Diſcipline is openly neglected; be ſure of this, that the Leaven of Sin and Wickedneſs remains a Leaven to be avoided to this day, and the danger of leaping into leaprous Houſes is as great as ever; and the more refined a Church out wardly ſeems to be, yet if Wickedneſs do allowedly lodge
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34102:48"/> in it, the more dangerous will ſuch a Society be to you: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a Golden Cup, but the Poyſon of Aſps was in it; you would account it a high piece of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption againſt God, ſhould you adventure to lodge in a Houſe infected with the Plague or Leproſie, when you may be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in other Houſes which are free from ſuch Diſeaſes, and are willing to receive you; and will you be leſs careful where to houſe and harbour your Souls? Therefore make your Choice of holy Societies and well-governed Congregations, then may you expect the Bleſſing of God upon you, and his Preſence with you.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This leads us to behold the end of all polluted and impenitent Churches, who wilfully perſiſt in their Impenitency; when they hold faſt their Iniquities and refuſe to return, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 5. Then the next thing to be done is, they muſt be pulled in pieces and caſt down to the Ground, they ſhall ſtand no longer, the great High Prieſt will root them up, even to the laſt Foundation Stone; what he commanded the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Prieſt to do to the Levitical Leprous Houſe, when no means would heal it, <hi>pull it down to the Ground,</hi> the ſame will he cauſe to be done to his Goſpel poluted Church, which refuſeth to be healed, Rev. 18. 21. <hi>Thus with violence ſhall Babylon that great City be thrown down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we may obſerve this Note for our Information: Doct. <hi>That when no Means uſed will heal and help the Leprous Churches of Chriſt, then will Chriſt unchurch ſuch Churches again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the handling of this Point, I ſhall firſt prove it; 2ly, Shew you what that Infection is which will endanger the unchurching of Chriſt's Churches; 3ly, Give you the Reaſons of it; And 4ly, apply the whole.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the Proof of this Point, you ſee how evident this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34102:49"/> appears from the Type it ſelf, where command was given for the pulling down the Levitical Houſe, when ſcraping of the Walls nor pulling out of the Stones would avail to the cleanſing of it: And this holds as true in the Anti-Type, How ſeverely did God make this good upon his Old Teſtament Houſe? Behold (ſaith Chriſt) I ſent unto you wiſe Men, and Prophets, and Scribes, ſome of them ye ſcourged, ſome ye have perſecuted, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led others of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 34. The ſending of theſe Prophets, wiſe Men, and Scribes to them was in order to their Healing, but they would not be healed; then mark what followed hereupon, <hi>Verſe</hi> 38. <hi>Behold your Houſes is left unto you deſolate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if you conſider the ſeven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, after they began to be Leprous, <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Pergamos, verſes</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira, verſe</hi> 20. <hi>Sardis, Chap</hi> 3. 2, 3. and <hi>Laodicea, verſe</hi> 15, 16, 17. Unto all theſe Churches was <hi>John</hi> the Divine ſent, as a means to heal them, by bringing them to Repentance, but becauſe they received no benefit by it, at length how hath the great High Prieſt of Heaven and Earth pulled them all to pieces and thrown them flat to the Ground? And what hath he done leſs to the Church of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Philippi, Theſſalonica,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but broke them all down to the Duſt, with the Stones thereof, and the Timber thereof, and the Mortar thereof, and hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be carried out of the City into an unclean place; for what uncleaner place can there be, than to lye in the Dregs of <hi>Mahometiſin?</hi> which is the condition of moſt of the Eaſtern Churches to this day.</p>
               <p>Here is one thing more to be obſerved, That this Levitical Rubbiſh muſt be carried without the City, which City was a Type of Chriſt's reformed Churches on Earth in Goſpel-times, for ſo are the Churches of Chriſt compar'd, Pſal. 122. 3. <hi>Jeruſalem is builded as a City compact together,</hi> which ſheweth us thus much, That ſuch Churches as are left and forſaken by Jeſus Chriſt, ought to be abandoned by the whole City of God.</p>
               <p>What though ſuch Churches (with <hi>Sardis)</hi> may have a Name to live, and may vainly glory in their ancient Title, of being once named a Church of Chriſt; yet in as much as they have loſt the vital Spirit of a Church, in ceaſing to hold Union with Chriſt, the true Head, they thereby forfeit their right of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the true Churches of Chriſt: alſo, Hoſea 4. 17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the Point proved, and ſo we come to ſhew you what kind of Polution it is, (which if Churches perſiſt in) will endanger their being unchurched again.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, a univerſal decay in their Love to Chriſt and one another, ſo ſaith <hi>Diodate,</hi> in his Annotations upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34102:49"/> there may be an abatement of Love to Chriſt, in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons in a Church, and yet no danger of the whole Churches be in; unchurched; God is ſo juſt and righteous, that he will not lay the Stroke upon the whole Church, when the Guilt is only chargable upon the leſſer number, Ezek. 18. 20. <hi>The Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it be the Sin of the Church in general, to fall back in their Love to Chriſt and one another, this is a dangerous ſtep to the unchurching of ſuch a Church: Read the threatning of Chriſt in this caſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt left thy first Love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent, and do the firſt Works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. An allowed Spirit of Formality and Lukewarmneſs, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sin which may endanger the unchurching of a Church of Chriſt; this frame of Spirit is very dangerous, if it be found in a particular Soul; a formal indifferent frame of Heart in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is not only a bad ſign but a bad diſtemper, it's like the Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpots appearing before death, and the diſtemper is like an Ague in the Body, which proves the foundation (ſometimes) of many other mortal Diſeaſes which ſucceed afterwards.</p>
               <p>The like is as true of a prevailing formal lukewarm Spirit in a Chriſtian, it uſhers into the Soul ſeveral other ſpiritual Maladies: when <hi>Ephraim</hi> became like a Cake not turned, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 8. that is, as we uſe to ſay, halfbaked, <hi>viz.</hi> formal and luke-warm, then ſuddenly it became proud, idolatrous, treacherous and rebellious againſt God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. 11. with <hi>chap.</hi> 9, 10. So that if this evil frame of Heart in a particular Chriſtian, be ſo deteſtable to God, how much more diſreliſhing to God, muſt a whole Society of Chriſtians be, where this evil ſpirit reigns in the power of it, eſpecially when this Diſeaſe in a whole Church is become ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, that it expels the Virtue of all good Means that ſhall be applied for the recovery of it? This greatly endangers the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of ſuch a Church.</p>
               <p>Rev. 3. 16. <hi>So then becauſe thou art luke-warm, neither hot nor cold, I will ſpue thee out of my Mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The third Sin which endangers the unchurching of a Church of Chriſt, is the ſin of profeſſed Idolatry, <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> Idolatry is a violating of the Marriage-Covenant betwixt a Church and Chriſt, and a defiling of the Marriage-Bed; which ſin in a Wife called for a Bill of Divorce, to divorce the Wife from her Husband, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 32. So that in Scripture, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry alſo is called Whoredom, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20. And it is called playing the Harlot, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 20. Now as the Law allowed a Man to put away his Wife for the ſin of Whoredom, ſo for the ſin of Idolatry, which is a ſpiritual Whoredom, will Jeſus Chriſt put
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34102:50"/> away a whole Church from him, unleſs it repents, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1. 6. with 8 and 9th verſes.</p>
               <p>4. A fourth Sin which helps forward the unchurching of a Church of Chriſt, is the Looſneſs and Profaneneſs of it: this kind of ſinning was charged upon the ten Tribes, as the ground of Chriſt's unchurching of them, and caſting them out of his ſight, though once a People in Covenant with him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 3, 4, 5. <hi>They make the King glad with their wickedneſs, and the Princes with their lies, they are all adulterers as an Oven heated by the Baker, who ceaſeth from riſing after he hath kneaded the Dough, until it be leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> So <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>They conſider not in their Hearts, that I remember all their wickedneſs, now their doings have beſet them about, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my face:</hi> but becauſe of the unreclaimable looſeneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs of this Church, Chriſt at laſt utterly renounceth them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Then ſaid God, call his name Loamini, for ye are not my People, and I will not be your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great reaſon why Chriſt takes a People into a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation with himſelf, is upon Terms of their Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Levit 19. 1, 2. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, ſpeak unto all the Congregation of the Children of Iſrael, and ſay unto them, ye ſhall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ever Chriſt chuſeth any to be his peculiar People, it ſhall be upon the ſame Terms which he redeemed them by his Bloud, and that was to be a peculiar People to him, zealous of good Works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. But then when that viſible Holineſs ceaſeth to be in a Church, which was the ground of that viſible Union which was betwixt Chriſt and them at firſt, the Union betwixt them is diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Jer. 7. 9. with the 15th Verſe, <hi>Will you ſteal, murder, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, and ſwear falſly, and burn incenſe unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not, and come and ſtand before me in this houſe, which is called by my Name, and ſay, We are delivered to do all theſe abominations:</hi> So 15 verſ. <hi>I will cast you out of my ſight, as I cast out all your Brethren, even the whole Seed of Ephraim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what the Sins are which do ſo pollute and defile the Churches of Chriſt, as do greatly endanger their being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched again: therefore where we find ſuch Pollution reigning in Churches, it's good to avoid them; and ſo we come to the Reaſons of the Point.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon why Chriſt will unchurch Leprous Churches, which will not be healed, is, becauſe he will thereby admoniſh all other Churches, that they may hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly.</p>
               <p>Rev. 2. 21, with 23. <hi>I gave her ſpace to repent of her fornication and ſhe repented not, I will kill her Children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:34102:50"/> 
                  <hi>Churches ſhall know that I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt's Severity upon ſome Offenders, will make others the more affraid to offend; when the angry Father takes up the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Child to correct it, this makes the reſt of the Children to quake and tremble.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon, It is ſo, becauſe Chriſt will perform the Truſt which is repoſed in him by his Father, with relation to the Churches, and that with the greateſt circumſpection: all the Churches of Chriſt in the World, were originally the Fathers, John 17. 6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gavest them to me:</hi> That is, the Father gave them to Chriſt, to be kept, watch'd over, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and ruled in his Father's Name, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. ſheweth; and one ſpecial purpoſe why the Father hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntruſted Chriſt with the care of his Churches, is, that God might have fruitful ſervice from them, John 15. 8. <hi>In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.</hi> The Church is God's Vineyard, and Chriſt is made the Vine-dreſſer of it, with this Commiſſion, That if any of the Vines proves ſo rotten, that inſtead of bringing forth of good Fruit, they bring forth nothing but wild Grapes; then muſt he cut down ſuch unfruitful Vines, Iſa. 5. 1, 2. with Verſ 5. <hi>My Beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful Hill, and he looked that it ſhould bring Grapes, and it brought forth wild Grapes; now I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard, I will take away the Hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up, and I will break down the Wall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and it ſhall be trodden down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Truſt our Lord Jeſus diſchargeth with a world of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on each hand; firſt of all, he diſchargeth this Truſt in order to the making of his Vineyard fruitful, Iſa. 27. 2, 3. <hi>In that day ſing ye to her a Vineyard of red Wine; I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment, leſt any hurt it; I will keep it night and day.</hi> Secondly, And he is as righteous to fulfil his Commiſſion upon them, if they prove unfruitful, Verſ. 5. of the 26th Chapter, <hi>For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty City he layeth low, he layeth it low even to the Ground, he bringeth it even to the Dust:</hi> So that if Churches will not be Trees of Righteouſneſs, Chriſt will fell them to the Ground for Trees of Rottenneſs; if they will not yield him Fruit for his Father's Table, they muſt be Fuel for his Father's Fire, Luke 3. 9. <hi>Now the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree, every Tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and caſt into the Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt is his Fathers Servant in this great Work, and the Will of his Father he muſt and will do, both in the preſervation of ſome, or deſtruction of other of his Churches in this Life, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34102:51"/> as they prove either fruitful or unfruitful in his ſight; for he came not to do his own Will, but the Will of him that ſent him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 38.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon. It muſt be ſo, becauſe Chriſt will manifeſt to all the World the Righteouſneſs of his Government over his Churches whilſt here on Earth. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. it's ſaid, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall be upon his Shoulder, and his Name ſhall be called the wonderful Counſellor; and as it ſhall not be ſaid, that ſo wonderful a Counſellor Rules indiſcreetly, ſo neither ſhall it be ſaid, that he rules his Churches unrighteouſly: It is ſaid, that Chriſt our Lord will order his Kingdom, and eſtabliſh it with Judgment and Juſtice for ever; therefore let thoſe Churches which will not be ſubject to the Government and Diſcipline of this high Governour, know their doom, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>And when the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred them, becauſe of the provoking of his Sons and of his Dvughters; and he ſaid, I will hide my Face from them, I will ſee what their end ſhall be, for they are a very froward Generation, Children in whom is no Faith; they have moved me to jealouſie with that which is no God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities, and I will move them to jealouſie with thoſe which are not a People: I will provoke them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by a fooliſh Nation, for a fire is kindled in my anger and ſhall burn to the loweſt Hell, and ſhall conſume the earth with her increaſe, and ſhall ſet on fire the foundation of the Mountains; I will heap miſchief upon them, I will ſpend my Arrows upon them, they ſhall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with a burning heat, and with bitter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I will ſend the teeth of wild Beaſt upon them, with the poyſon of Serpents of the duſt, the ſword without and terror within ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thy young Men, and the Virgin, the Suckling alſo, with the Man of gray Hairs.</hi> This will our Lord do to his polluted Churches, to vindicate his righteouſneſs in the Government which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth over them.</p>
               <p>So that I ſhall conclude with this hearty Prayer, That God would give you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things, that ſo you might have a clear diſcerning of the fatal Ruine which is like to light upon our Luke-warm Congregations, who have the Leproſie of ſo much Formality upon them, who with <hi>Sardis</hi> have a Name to live, but are dead, and that you may be of the few Names in <hi>Sardis,</hi> which have not defiled your Garments, and having your Lamps trimmed, your Lights burning, and Garments ſhining, and ſo accounted worthy to walk in white with your dear Lord Jeſus, both now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
